Review_Header,Review_Detail
My dogs love it - but currently out of stock,"Yes and yes! Both my border collie and Chihuahua mix love it! Only that now it’s out of stock and I have to switch to the chicken flavor- I prefer to choose fish because intuitively speaking it would provide more omega acid which should be beneficial to their health… but don’t have detailed stats or hard evidence for that. I have already purchased the yellow chicken bag, will update whether they like that flavor."
I've not had problems with this food,"I've had no problems with this brand of BB dog food.  I just started shipments 2 months ago.  After reading the 1 star comments I was concerned, but giving issues a thought it could be from over heating if delivered in summer.  Dogfood maybe dry but there is moisture in it to an extent.  If it goes from cool to hot moisture can occur (even with the dog food in the stores).  I will certainly keep an eye on my dogs delivered food.  But, I am not going to stop my shipments unless it is during a very HOT stretch of summer then I may pause shipments for those months.  I do have to say BB is very good dog food.  I own 7 Miniature Australian Shepherds and 1 toy Dachshund. 1 Aussie has some food allergies that dissappear with this food."
Inconsistent quality,"My dog has been eating this dog food for 10 years now. I have noticed that when I order it from Amazon the bags contents are very different from one to the other. Color, size, smell and sometimes the points cards are missing which makes me think the bags are very old. This last order the pieces were smaller and smelled better. Previous order they were bigger and lighter in color. When it comes to amazon I'm always worried about dupes and when it comes to consumables that can be dangerous."
My dog loves it!,"My dogs have been eating this a few years now and they love it. One of my dogs has pancreatitis and he was on prescription dog food for awhile, but it was insanely expensive. When I found this dog food, we tried it out and have had no issues at all."
My dogs love this and they eat it all,My dogs eat anything but I noticed they take their time with some food eating it or don’t eat it at all but with this they eat it all and even have more energy
Nutritious and apparently tastes good,We feed blue buffalo products to our Heeler and our lab/Pitt mix.
Best dog food,Love the convenience of having it delivered to my door. Best dog food for my pugs. Fast delivery
Size,Smaller than I expected for the price. Better deal at Sam’s
Good  Food,"Most dogs take some time to adjust to new food, but I mixed this in with his previous dry food for a while, and he was soon ready to eat this on its own. He likes it in addition to the cooked turkey or chicken I put on top for meals. This is more nutritious than his previous dry food, so I’m happy."
Great Food,I have 3 shiatzu's and they love this food and the fish flavor. It has helped my oldest with his digestive problems. Highly recommend
Good quality,Dog loves it
Most important— my dog likes it,Comes in small pieces which is important for a small dog
Great for picky dog eaters.,"my dog is a picky eater. will avoid kibble for days until shes starved enough to stomach it. Have tried many brands. Shell eat this without much hassle. She still isnt the biggest fan, only eats about 2/3 of her meal.This also smells the best from all the other kibbles we've had. theres a strong smell of soysauce on it. I think that helps."
My dogs love it,"My dogs get tired of their food regularly but this, they love"
The only food my dog eats,My dog has been eating this for the last year. It isn't the best overall dry food but is far from the worst. It is a good quality choice.
My dog loves it,My dog loves this product. Will return if this turns out to be a healthy choice for him.
"Its great for your dog, and no waste.","My dog likes the taste, and is staying heathy and lean."
Great Product,My dogs love this product. They seem to have more energy. Not weighed down with all the additives.
The dogs balked at the previous dry food. They eat this kind.,"I used to think all dogs were always hungry and would always eat. My current pack is nothing like that. I switch around with both wet and dry dog food, as well as whether the pack gets dry in the morning, wet for dinner, or vice versa, sometimes the same thing both times. And snacks. Lots of snacks. I try to keep them from getting bored while also developing a familiarity, two obviously contradictory goals. They generally stop eating any kind of dry food I've given them, from Purina to Nutra Nugget, after a while. This one, Blue Buffalo, they'll still turn up their nose to, if they can weasel their way into getting me to make them burgers or salmon or chicken (their favorite.) Instead of picking through their bowls for the meat and leaving the dry food to sit until later (just before bed), they'll eat this too. I don't have high expectations, so having them eat what I give them, when I give it to them, counts as a win for me."
Our dogs love it,Our boxer and mixed German Sheppard love the food and haven't had any issues. We will continue to order.
Exactly what I wanted!!,"Great healthy dog food, normal price point, fast delivery!"
Great quality,Fast shipping and great quality as always
Quality food,Price was high but quality is good
My dogs seem to love it,"My Rottie was having skin issues, since I’ve put him on Blue Buffalo, the problem has cleared! I honestly think it was something in the other dog foods he was allergic to."
Dog loves the flavor.,"I was looking for a new dog food for my dog. Came across this, and she loves it"
7 Dogs love it,My dogs love the flavor and texture.  Also good for their teeth
dog loves this food her coat is a lot softer,she loves this food and her energy is a little more than before. Thanks for being on prime!!
Great Product and very good price.,"Search a lot of other foods and for the size and quality, this is the one I need for my dog."
my dog loves this food,This is very high quality dog food that my dog loves.
Happy with this for my dog,We're happy with this dog food. My dog seems to like it.
Good product.WAY OVERPRICED,"Too costly. I like the product for my pets, but it can't be returned so try to find a local vendor."
No more scratching,"We have at least one dog that is allergic to poultry.  This is far cheaper than buying  it at Publix, plus the dogs are no longer scratching and in misery.  So much easier to have it delivered than for my disabled son to try and hoist it out of the trunk once we are home."
Not suitable for picky eaters,"My dogs typically aren’t picky and they were very finicky with this food. They barely at any of it. I decided to order another flavor. Hopefully they like the beef flavor. HOWEVER, my cat would not stay away from this dog food. We had to pick up the bowls so he would not eat it."
Nice small easily digested nuggets.,Dog ate this first time I  fed  her this  new dogfood. Also enjoyed when mixed with canned food.
Blue Buffalo Dry Dog Food,My two large dogs have always done well with BB dog food. They've been eating it since they were pups. I received a big bag of dry Lamb & rice food rvery 2 weeks. The food has always been good quality with high protein & low fat.I recommend.
My dogs love this,"I was looking for something healthier to feed my dogs and they seem to love this.  My only complaint is the price, I wish it were cheaper."
Blue buffalo food,This is the only food we use for our fur babies.
Better ingredients than prior dog food,"One of our dogs has allergies and weight issues.  So far, this food is helping.  We want to get him to a healthy weight, but also not make his skin allergies worse."
good stuff,;good stuff
Dogs have been sick for a week,"I agree with another reviewer. My 2 dogs have been eaten this food for a long time. However, during the past week and a half, both have been showing signs of not feeling well. I suspected the food. Then last night, one of the dogs had a major attack of diarhea on the kitchen floor (yeah, smart dog). I'm going to toss mine too and head over to the local source. It might be the heat causing the food to go bad. I just thought others should know about this too."
Will stick with B. B.,Tried the Amazon brand food bc I am cheap. It really messed with my dog's gut. They all were gassy and stinky. Bought Blue Buffalo afterwards and hoped the splurge would fix the problem. It did! I am so glad. I won't stray again.
great for picky dogs (at least for both of mine),"This food works great for both my dogs. I will write out a description of their dog food history and health history to see if this food works for you!First dog, 4 years old german shepherd mix rescue:- she has many allergies (but no food allergies) and this is one of the only foods that does not make her itch- her ""business"" is always regular and she never direaha (she used to on Kirkland food)- her coat is healthy- affordable for the ingredients / quality- she is very picky for other foods (wont accept it as treat, will only eat once a day), but with this, she is always hungry for itSecond dog, 1 year old corgi:- used to buy Arcana for him thinking that he would love it, but he got tired of it and I switched him to her food. He loves this food so much more.- his ""business"" is always regular- no issues at all since he switched to this foodoverall, i would say try it out to see if your pet likes it! both of mine love it"
"Dog loves it, shipping frequently a mess!","The dog loves it, he’s an English Bulldog and their tummy’s can be sensitive but this works for him.  The issue is USPS delivers this package (for some reason) and it arrives damaged on a regular basis.  Frequently (more then 3 times or I wouldn’t bother writing this) the box is broken, ripped, and damaged.  Amazon customer service responds quickly to remedy the issue.  However, it’s easily fixed with just some attention to detail on the Post Office delivery people."
Power to change!,"Bears had just fought 2 cancers and was in horrible shape I decided to switch to this when he got CHUSINGS DIEASE dianagosis right 2 months after his last cancer surgery. His skin was in terrible shape, he was getting cysts, clogged pores, major hair loss especially. And oh! The weight gain..in five months he put on almost 15 pnds topping off at 123, he's normally around 103-108. After just 3 months it's really incredible he's long beautiful coat is coming back in that I loved so much, he's energetic agin and down 15 pounds ..moving to 5 acres helped and praise all that's holy no more nasty cysts! I'm so happy to say their is a DOG FOOD that's NUTRITIOUS AND GOOD for OUR DOGS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM..Iam paying about 18 dollars  more each month but to keep my best friend by my side is so WORTH IT!"
My dog is sick,"My dog is 12 years old and he has been on blue buffalo for 11 years. I have the chicken and rice on subscription for years. The bag I received on Oct 12 I started feeding my dog about a week later and he started getting diarrhea and upset stomach, I cooked him food for a week and after slowly reintroducing him back to this food (wasn’t sure it was the food that caused it) he was sick again."
The taste and quanity.pitbull,Everything was great.
My dog loves it,We ended up with a subscription for it because our little dog loves it and it's so convenient!
good quality food for the pet,"My dog eats a different brand. however, it was not available. when I put it in the dog bowl he gobbled it up and wanted more. So I guess it tastes good. He loves it"
Best dog food,"I've been feeding this to my dogs for many years, so I thought I'd finally write a review.  This is the only dog food I've found that every dog I've ever had loves to eat.  I prefer feeding my dogs food with good ingredients, and this fits the bill.  Is it expensive?  Yep, but my guys are worth it."
Great,My dog loves this food.  She seems healthier and happier than when I was giving her another brand
Dog is happy,Have been using Blue Buffalo for years now. We have one of the laziest dog so this formula is perfect for a dog that refuses to move.
Moldy batch,Beware - I’ve been ordering from here for heard (i have the subscription) and we opened our new bag today and it was moldy and wet. :( Had to run to the store to get a replacement so my pups could eat.
Great product,My dog loves it
Easy on pets stomachs,My boxers have very sensitive tummys and Blue Buffalo keeps then feeling like champs.
Ace is my grand pup and he love is Blue Buffalo,Ace is my grand pup and he love is Blue Buffalo
Dogs Ate It BUT..,Our dogs left the little round pieces all over the floor. They loved the bigger pieces so I think the rice is the little round balls and our two picky eaters want only the meat. Other two dogs ate it all and cleaned up after the two picky eaters.
"Great, but our two wire haired fox terriers prefer the Blue Jolly Joints.","Great, but our two wire haired fox terriers prefer the Blue Jolly Joints."
River doesn't like the round pieces.,"My dog is NOT a picky eater, but she leaves the little round pieces all around her bowl.  I'm not sure what makes them different than the larger pieces but she won't eat them!I'm wasting half of the dog food.  I won't buy it again.I do think it's funny that she can spit the round ones out of her mouth.  I've never seen her do that before.I will be sticking with Solid Gold."
Packaging for the bags rips easily,"Ripped packaging, which means it could have been sitting on a shelf for quite a while with a rip before arriving here for the dog. Makes you question the freshness or safety of the food. Had to refund. 3 stars because i got a refund, otherwise it would be 1 star"
My Dog eats it,"Dog food, dogs eat it and don't starve"
Good stuff,Good stuff
Why the exceptionally large / unaffordable price increase?,"I needed to purchase a high quality, healthy, weight maintenance dog food for our * year old Lab mix Daisy. She has ballooned to 116 pounds in June since I am no longer able to take her for long walks. With the weight gain she has become lethargic, sleeping all hours even during the day and has become uninterested in playing with any of her toys. In addition to her not getting enough exercise she is acting very depressed and I can relate it to first the loss of mybeloved Australian Sheppard ""Dito"" 6 months ago and 2 weeks later the death of my wonderful husband in May from COVID.  We all need to exercise and eat our way back to health. I talked to my vet and did my own research and found the Blue Buffalo Healthy Weight Life protection formula. The cost was out of my reach in our local grocery store so I checked here on Amazon. On August 1st I bought a 30 lb bag of the chicken and brown rice formula for $35.53. Daisy did not complain at all as I started to mix it gradually into her food. Feeding her 2 cups twice daily she started to lose weight without begging for scraps or treats so I assume she was satisfied. A visit in September to the vet had a weigh in of 101 pounds. Amazing. She was able to jump up on the bed, looking to play tug with her giant rope and had a little spirit again. The vet wants her at 80 pounds so we intend to keep her on this food. Due to the mixing with daisy's old food for the first 14 day, that bag lasted 7 weeks. I purchased another 30 lb bag on September 20 for $34.26. I was checking prices on Prime Day for many of the deals and decided to buy another bag before I ran out and was shocked to find the price ""Starting at $54.88"" for the same 30 lb bag and not available as prime. That is a $20.00 increase!! Why?? I will find it very difficult to spend that much and I do not want to switch her food when she is doing so well now. I hope this increase is temporary...please."
My dog enjoyed this,Thor really liked this food and gobbled it up at his mealtime!
Dogs are happy!,Good product dogs are very healthy
Great size for 30 pound dogs and under.,The small adult bites helps my small dog chew through them. She likes to mow through her food so I had worries of her chocking or getting sick from the fast consumption. These small bites are just enough for her and I'm less worried for her chocking :)
Great Food For My Loving Pet,Love the value and price. Within my budget.
My dog loves it!,"While I couldn’t bring myself to taste test it, my dog has and absolutely loves it. It seems to be his favorite dry food and has a good mix of higher quality ingredients.My dog gives it two paws up!"
Met Satisfaction,Used with mix dog has been used to.  She slightly prefers the older but eats both.  Am ordering more.
great value,great value
my dogs loved,i like the facts is not belly issues with my dogsi use this product for almost 15 years or more i have chow chow breeds for all this time and this is the best for the money.totally worthedrudystay strong
Puppy liked it,Good size lasted about 3 months
My dogs love the food,My dogs live the food and they are healthy.
Like the 38pd size!!!,My standard poodle loves her food!!!!
Dogs love it,My dog was throwing up and having tummy issues before so i decided to take the plunge financially and try Blue and my dog has had no more issues!!!! They love it! I would have given it 5 stars but this bag came very crushed with a lot of powder instead of the bits.They send reward points in the bag and those are fun to get and use to get free things for the pups!!
Dog is happy,"My dog gets lots of energy from this food. The only thing I don’t like about this dog food is the bag it comes in. No matter from where I order this product, the bag ends up being busted in the box, with food spilling out. The quality of the bag - isn’t strong enough to carry the weight."
Dogs love it,Great food
Best Dog Food!,"I had my 10lb chihuahua on Hills Science Diet Lamb and Rice and a vitamin supplement. She would not eat all her food or even not at all. Her coat would be drab and she itched all the time from dry skin even after adding vitamin supplements. I decided to try Blue Buffalo Chicken and Rice. Not only was it the same cost as I was paying for Hills it weighed a pound more. My dog absolutely loves it. Plus, I do not have to give her whole cup of food and baked chicken to fill her up when she would even eat the dry food. She always managed to eat the baked chicken though.I now give her the recommended amount of 1/4-1cup. I give her 1/4 dry and mix some baked chicken with the Blue Buffalo and she eats all of it up all of the time. No left overs. Her coat and skin is not as dry like before and I was able to stop adding vitamin supplements saving me money. My dog was transformed within 3 weeks to 1 month. I highly recommend this product."
My dog loves it,My dog has been eating it for a few years now
My dog LOVES it!,My dog absolutely loves this product and flavor! It's worth the money. And that big bag will last me about a month and a half!
He eats it and loves it!,To feed my dog?!
Not my dog's favorite,"I usually buy the chicken flavor but saw the beef and thought ""hey, why not"". Well, Nina Simone Biles did not appreciate the switch and ate it very sparingly. Eventually I bought a bag of the chicken flavor and mixed the two flavors together."
Amazing!,"I have a GSD and he used to shed like crazy. Since changing To this food, his skin is better and his shedding has decreased substantially. I also love that Amazon ships this for me on a regular schedule without me having to go in and purchase it every time. You can also change the frequency in which it’s sent. Life changing on both parts."
All of my pets are fed Blue Buffalo,I like the quality but the prices are getting too high.
Great product,Dogs eat all of it...no waste.
Great buy,My dog love it
My dog could not wait for me to get the bag open!,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, my dog could not wait for me to get the bag open & pour him a bowl! I hope it’s as good for him as they say."
Dog food,I have been buying it once a month for over 4 year's.Yes my dog likes it and it meets our needs.Do you really need to ask me every month for a review?
Dogs Enjoyed This!,The dogs seemed to enjoy this more than their regular brand. It's more expensive so I will purchase when I can but it seems worth the price.
Nutritional information,"I've never been able to afford Blue for my babies. But my circumstances have changed and I have tried Blue and they love it. In only a week I can see an improvement in their vitality and overall health.  This ain't no commercial,  but I'll never switch again. Even if I have to go without!"
Great product,"This product is the ""bumper diggidy"" . My pet loves it ."
Flawless transition from previous food.,My 5 year old pup didn't blink an eye at the change. She gobbles it right down and has maintained healthy bowel habits.
Best for our dog,It the best food for our dog the ingredients our great also it he likes it
Blue Buffalo is our favorite,My pup really enjoys this brand. It doesn’t harm her tummy and she has not had any bouts of tummy irritation since we began feeding her it.
Great product,"Claire, my Italian Greyhound loves this food and if she could eat the entire bag she would"
Buffalo for the win,I started my lab on Buffalo back when he started having digestive issues. And have never switched and never will. Their health = my happiness 😀
Delicious for my dog,"My dog loves it!  She gobbles it down so fast, I figured it must be some good food."
Dogs enjoy!,We had to switch from Iams due to Iams causing one of the dogs to be excessively gassy.  Blue Buffalo seems to be more gentle on their stomach.  Vet recommended this brand.  So far so good.  We do have it set up on automatic shipment which is a nice convenience.
Nutrition,My dogs love it and it is healthy for them.  Keeps their bowels regular
"Can't Vouch for the Flavor, Tippy Don't Talk!  But What's with the ""Healthy HOLISTIC"" Label??? !","To know how this tastes, we'd need a talking dog.Will someone esplaine the ""Healthy and HOLISTIC"" printing on the top front of the bag?I looked, but couldn't find any holes.  Looks like it was translated in a far off place.Surprising, for pet food that wasn't purchased because it was inexpensive..."
Helped eliminate Aussie's skin issues!,"Our 7 year old Australian Shepherd was having very severe skin issues.  Our vet couldn't find the cause and suggested to switch foods.  We'd been feeding Merrick & Merrick's cheaper brand Whole Earth Farms for years, never thinking it was the food since his potty time was always fine & other than the skin issues he was in great health.  Being so sick & tired of his poor skin problems I gave Blue Buffalo a shot & I gave it several bags before I made a decision as to if it was helping at all or doing nothing.  I figured the food would probably have nothing to do with any of the skin issues and was just taking a shot in the dark picking Blue Buffalo.  I was absolutely shocked that his skin issues are totally 100% gone now - all cleared up & 100% healed!  Now I do want to be super clear here & state that I honestly believe it was the removal of his old food that was what caused this amazing improvement, not the addition of Blue Buffalo.  Hope that makes sense!I mean that, I think any other good quality food would have very likely caused improvement in his skin issues.  I just happened to choose Blue Buffalo & it just happened to work great for us!  It's good quality nutrition, our Aussie seems to like the taste, it's always available here on Amazon & if for some reason I don't want the Chicken & Rice at any point there are plenty other varieties to choose from.  I really love when pet food companies have various kinds & flavors so we can keep our dog's digestive system regular & give him some variety to keep him excited about food!  We can switch between any of the varieties without any fuss because most of them have very similar ingredients. The biggest positive I can report is, we didn't transition him at all from his old food to Blue Buffalo.  So we were expecting some not-so-great potty results.  Nope!  All went smooth & no changes in his digestive system!  We have ALWAYS had major trouble if we didn't switch him slowly, so I was really surprised nothing happened negatively & his food transition went as easy as pie!  I personally as of now highly recommend Blue Buffalo!"
Dog food rocks. Shipping sucks.,Our dogs love blue diamond. We’ve tried different brands and always come back to this. I wish they didn’t use USPS to ship. They won’t ship oversized packages and you have to go to the USPS office to pick it up. Defeats the whole purpose of Amazon!!
"I like the food, sadly, my dog doesn't :(","I read a lot about this food prior to making my purchase. My dog recently suffered from life-threatening bloat...amazingly she survived :) To reduce the chances of future bloat I am now feeding her 4-5 times a day instead of only once. After researching, I found that a food high in protein and low in carbs/corn type grains was healthier and possibly less likely to cause bloat (there is very little known as to the causes of bloat so most information is just theoretical...no definitive findings). Well, I was happy to find that Blue Buffalo foods seemed to be tailored to exactly what I was in search of! In addition, my dog suffers from allergies and I had been supplementing her with Alaskan Salmon Oil for added Omega-3 and Omega-6. After reading about the Blue Buffalo Fish & Sweet Potato food I saw that it offered the additional Omega's and that if she was to eat it I would no longer need to do the separate supplement. Everything sounded wonderful! I placed my order and it arrived promptly. I tried getting her to eat the food for about a week or two before I decided it was a no go :( I tried mixing it with hot water for gravy...still, she never did take to it. She is typically a very accepting dog when new foods are introduced...however, with this food she was not. I wasn't bothered by the smell as were some other reviewers, but I'm not surprised by that since I had become accustomed to the salmon oil smell already. All in all, I do wish she had taken to the Blue Buffalo brand foods as I really like the approach they take with the ingredients and preparation methods. I tried her on the Lamb flavor too but she refused that as well. Although my experience with Blue Buffalo brand turned out to be one that wouldn't work, I would still recommend giving it a try for your pampered pup. It is a great food! Great ingredients! And made in the U.S.A. which is a definite plus! If you have the same problem that I did, the company offers a 30-day money guarantee through whatever retailer you buy from...IT'S WORTH A TRY FOR SURE!!! If you visit their website and fill in a short form they will snail-mail you a $5.00 off any size bag coupon :)"
Very satisfied little customer!,The dog enjoys this brand.  I cannot give him any other!  I tried others and he always loves this one.  I give this an A+++ from my dog!
Healthier Food for your dog,"My dogs like this Food. They eat it and their stool comes out solid. They're happy, I'm happy."
Blue buffalo dog food,My little ones love this food. It is perfect size if bites for small dogs. My dog never had any stomach problems  after it. Highly recommended.
Picky,My dog refuses to eat the little brown pieces. I have no clue why.
Bag sliced open,                    The media could not be loaded.
Good quality food for my boxer,                
My dog loves buffalo blue food," The dog food bag was sliced on one area of the bag, with dog food scattered in the box, giving us less than what we usually get for a 15lb bag. More like have a bag."
Blue Buffalo Dog Food,"Our boxer is a pretty picky eater. She has been having problems keeping weight on, so I was trying different foods. She loves this blue buffalo blend, so we have been feeding it to her for about 6 months. I won’t lie it is little pricy for dry food but my dogs are member of the family and deserve quality! She has regained some weight she had lost and just overall happier. That is what is important! I saw I could do auto delivery on Amazon so I tried it out. It is working out great and makes things very simple. I recommend it for the little extra discount and connivence"
My fur baby cleans the bowl,"She loves the beef and chicken, I also put the dry food in it Also."
Dog went straight for it.,My dogs love this food. Bonus that it is affordable
I Just Rated this Dog Food as Tasting Good,"My basset hound can be very particular when it comes to dry dog food.  Usually, she'll start at eating it, but then gets bored and I end up trying to doctor it up, so she eats it.  With Blue Buffalo, so far, she doesn't even hesitate when I put it in her bowl.  She's on her second bag, so fingers crossed."
Blue Buffalo is the best for your kids 🦮  🐾  also helps with their allergies,"My dog is certainly picky. She will eat dry food only when nothing else is around. That includes Iams and all the other preferable brands.Shipment arrived, poured into bowl and she did not hesitate. Very happy with purchase."
HEALTHY INGREDIENTS!,"Look - from what I can tell - this is good dog food - it’s a little expensive, but it’s supposedly to be a premium dog food - and there certainly are premium dog foods that cost more.I did lie a little in this review - as Amazon asked me how the flavor of this dog food was - I said it tasted good - but I really don’t know that - I didn’t actually eat it myself. My dog seems to like it - but lately he’s not speaking to me - so I can’t be sure! Dogs actually only have about 1/6th of human tastebuds - so, there’s a possibility it tastes like crap - but dogs don’t really know any better!"
"I Like The Poop, My Dogs Like The Food","I HAVE A GOLDENDUDDLE , AN ABUSED RESCUE PITBULL, AN 2 COCKER SPANIELS  “ CANDY AND SHILO “ THEY LOVE LAMB AND BROWN RICE ( BLUE BUFFALO)  THEY BEEN EATING THIS FOOD FOR YEARS . THEY ARE VERY HEALTHY THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS CANDY’S ALLERGIES BUT IS A TREATMENT THAT SHE HAS AND PART OF IT IS THE FOOD TOO. BLUE BUFFALO FOR THEM IS THE BEST BECAUSE I TRY OTHERS AND WOULDN’T EAT IT . I RECOMMEND BLUE BUFFALO LAMB AND BROWN RICE 100%"
Late but worth the wait,Both of my dogs love it and are thriving on this dog food!!!
My dog liked it for two days,"I switched to Blue Buffalo on a recommendation from my mother who has had bulldogs for years.  I had been using Iams Weight Control for my two Cocker Spaniels.  I gradually transitioned from the Iams to BB.  As the transition progressed, my dogs appeared to be more hungry at each feeding.  As it turned out, I think that they were just starting to enjoy their food for the first time in their short little lives. Sad, really.  But how can a person tell if a dog food actually tastes good?  If I were to pick a dog food based on what I THINK might taste good, I would be feeding my dogs Beneful dog food (their commercials make ME hungry).  In any case, they seem to love BB.  So that's the review from the dog's point of view.As for how this change in dog food has impacted MY life.  I live on a half acre and my two cockers can really spread wealth, if you know what I mean.  I really like to keep the lawn ""bomb free"" so my kids and I pick-up the lawn often.  When the dogs were eating Iams, the ""surprises"" that they would create would lay softly beneath the top blades of grass, just waiting for someone to come step on them.  It was too often an ugly situation that I will not describe here.  Since we have been feeding the dogs BB, those ""duce-balls"" now sit lightly upon the TOP of the grass.  They are light, easy to see and very firm (Eauwwwww!) As a result, pick-up is quicker and the lawn is cleaner.I suggest you give this food a try, but be cautious.  Based on some reviews, BB has had some quality problems in the past.  Nobody wants to lose their animal due to negligence on the part of a dog food company.  As with any change in your dog's diet, monitor closely.  Even if a food is safe and healthy, not all foods agree with all animals.  So remember, be cautious, we all want the best for man's best friend."
"Switched to a different type of food, but not mad at this one.",Awesome food. Fills my dogs up. It's like medicine... Very impressed.
Good dog food,Way too expensive.
Good,"So, my dog was fine eating this. He started on the puppy formula and progressed to adult formula. His poop was a little yellow and sometimes loose, so I switched him the BB's Limited Ingredient recipe that had lamb to see if that had an effect. I think chicken just isn't something his body handles in larger quantities (treats with chicken do not seem to impact him much), but that isn't the food's fault. Transferring to lamb basically instantly work for him. So, before you blame the brand, give either another protein a shot or try their grain-free or limited options. I try to keep my dog and a fairly monitored diet and preferred limited ingredient items. I did order this using Prime and as a one-time purchase. I do not advise buying food related items from a third party seller, but I have never had an issue with Prime items. The package arrive undamaged and no bug issues. Just make sure you check the bag and expiration before use because if food is exposed or outdated then of course you will see negative side effects. We keep this food in a storage tub in a room not exposed to sunlight, if that matters."
My girl loves it!,Our dogs love Blue Buffalo so I thought I would sign up for the auto delivery.  The first bag we received had a big cut in the side so not sure how fresh the product actually is.  Hopefully future bags are not cut open.
Perfect for our adult dog,Good
Wonderful foid,"My 6 month puppy loves everything about this product.  Digested well, poops without difficulty."
Subscribe!!,"We wanted something with natural ingredients, some thing that would not upset the stomach of our black lab/border collie mix adult dog. She is 11 years old. She is susceptible to digestive issues.Now all we feed her is Blue Mountain dog food, and it’s perfect. Unless she gets into something she shouldn’t be eating, she has absolutely no digestive issues at all. Very happy with the product."
Gooooodddddd,If your pets allergic to chicken this is a great alternative mine loves it.
"I just want a healthy dog, and this food helps with that.","I’ve waited 10+ 50lbs bags of chicken and brown rice dog food to review. This is definitely a great dog food option. My dogs get excited to eat this food every time I’m prepping it, plain!! Being a legit ingredients list is what drew me to it as an option for my dogs. (Switching food will cause some bathroom problems. My dogs went through it and are fine with the diet change now. Took a few weeks. They’re inside dogs and didn’t have any problems.)"
"Sadie is pretty picky about her food, but she eats this stuff up.","My dog love this flavor alot. I have a 4 years old pug and I try so many brand for him just wanna find a brand that he like and here we are. It smell good not like the other brands. He seem to eat more since I switched to this. Anyway, its so far so good. The shipment just came on time too"
"Have rescues, 12 & 8 years old. Both very healthy.","I’ve been feeding Jimmy Blue Buffalo since 10 weeks old. His coat is always shiny, no dandruff. I believe it’s well worth the price."
My precious baby loves it,"Kind of a strong odor when you first open the bag, but as long as she is happy and healthy, I'm okay with it."
My dog loves it!,Pricey but worth it.
My dogs love it,He is usually such a finicky eater but he chows this healthy food down. And it’s half the price of “designer “ dog food my vet recommends (and sells) and he actually eats it.
Been using product for several years.  Pets like it,We adopted our pittie girl a couple years ago and she couldn’t eat the brand of food our previous dog ate. I thought I’d try this and she loved it and still loves it! I can’t speak for ingredient quality exactly but it seems to be way better than the other brand.
"Good solid food for my picky eater, great ingredients, trust worthy. WITH grain.",My girl dog is super picky but she love it. And I'm happy I switch up flavors when I need to
Dog loves,Been using product for several years.  Pets like it
Great Dog Food,"I have used blue buffalo from the beginning. I have switched around a bit with the no grain, grain blah blah. I have come to the conclusion for my dog that grain is the way to go and thank goodness blue buffalo has a few options left, this being one. My border collie does great with this one. Reasonable price and easy to get."
Our dogs love it and more affordable than Hills,I have a Malshi who is 11 years old. Was told to try a healthier dog food because of skin issues. She is picky and wasn't a big fan of dry dog food until this brand. I gave 5 stars for the flavor because she likes it but I have not tried myself. :)
Dog food,"We've been buying Blue Buffalo for over a decade.  We switched from their Grain-Free version to the current Adult: Life Protection Formula after our vet conveyed that the community was concerned over specific health issues arising from major brand grain-free diets (not specifically Blue Buffalo), despite the causation being as yet unknown.  The dogs didn't seem to mind the change.We like the ingredient list, although we haven't personally chemically tested the food to confirm its accuracy.The freshness is apparent when you open the bag, and we've been buying for years and never gotten one that wasn't fresh.I cannot personally attest to the flavor.  The dogs do seem to like it, though they're picky little princesses so they prefer it mixed with a bit of chicken broth or a little wet food."
My dog loves it!,Weight management for older dogs. Dogs like it better than Hills. Certainly easier to find and considerably less expensive.
Delicious!,I usually buy Royal Cabin dry food geared especially for Golden retrievers. It became wildly expensive so I searched for the next best brand with a reasonable price. The dogs seem to love it. And it is so much more affordable.
So far so good!,I like everything about this dog food - since my dog likes it a lot and it's not full of artificial coloring - except the price.  It's just about doubled in a couple of years.  So I'm looking for a cheaper source....  But do highly recommend the product.
Changed seller Smaller bag More money,"My dog gobbles it up like it’s his last meal, and has for most of his life. While I can’t completely contribute it to the food, he’s 12 and still runs around like a puppy."
Both dogs like it!,No complains from the dog yet! 😉
My dog (and cat) loves it- but allergic,This was a good deal that I was going to subscribe to and the second order was $11 more and 8 lbs. lighter. So I guess I'm not getting any more on prime.
Great value,Both dogs like it. It's good quality
Kinda disappointed ☹️.,"The dog loves it, she kept trying to steal it while I was filling up/mixing with the old brand (Nutro) in her food storage container. I've also caught the cat stealing a couple pieces now and then during breakfast time! The stink is strong (meaty), probably why she loves it.***UPDATE my dog is apparently allergic to something in this. She's so itchy, eyes are watery and red, skin raw from rubbing. I feel so bad. We are transitioning to Inception dog food which after some research seems great for sensitive dogs."
good for dogs,When we ordered this came from Sams Club and was 38 pounds of food. What a bargain.
Your dog will luv it!,"After calling their headquarters, they told me that all their food bags have those brown bits, so I am disappointed 😞☹️.I have a small Yorkie who likes dry dog food.  But I am disappointed ☹️.  I called Blue company in Arizona and found out that many small breed dogs will take out the little brown bites of antioxidants and set them next to the bowl.  I was told to add warm water or broth, which didn't help.  I did like the fact that my dog's coat really improved.  Very shiny, so it is better than the store brand Ceasers that he was eating."
It got rid of my boxer's cysts!,Blue Buffalo is really good and all my dogs love it.
My dog has allergies and this food cleared her skin up,Great choice. Our dog loves it especially when it’s slightly heated.
Not Just The Bag Color That's Different,"My boxer loves it. I fed her the regular Blue Buffalo before because its pretty much the only kind she'll eat, without me having to mix in chicken breast or Cottage Cheese. She's a picky eater lolI don't know what's in this Healthy Weight stuff, or what's different between this one and the regular Blue Buffalo, but for over a year my dog had 2 pretty large cysts on her neck and her flank, that kept getting bigger and would sometimes burst open and leak, only to fill back up. (Both were benign) The vet told me I could have them removed and gave me an estimate....Within a month of feeding her the Healthy Weight, THEY DISAPPEARED. They're gone.Could the Makers of Blue Buffalo please tell me what's in it or isn't in it, that made the cysts go away?? Would be interesting to know, because cysts are very common in boxers.It could help other dog owners too, by avoiding certain ingredients or brands.I just saved a bunch of money (in surgery cost) by switching to Healthy Weight!Thanks"
Digestible,My dog was on an expensive hypoallergenic food but this is more affordable and she’s stopped itching! Plus she loves it! Eats it dry where she wouldn’t eat her other food if it didn’t have wet food in it!
Can’t tell you how it taste 🤷‍♀️.. it’s for dog  lol. But he seems to enjoy🐾✌️🙌,"So, this has been my Border Collie's food for two and a half years and he could barely wait until I got it into the bowl for him to eat it (my dog LOVES fish like none other). But that's completely changed.So, the bag color used to be pink for the fish and brown rice recipe and it used to smell really fishy. I mean, it was so fishy smelling that I had to buy an expensive container that fully sealed the food so I wouldn't have to smell it because I absolutely hate fish, but my dog loves it.Last month, we got a blue bag instead of pink. When I looked it up, I saw that Blue Buffalo had changed their bag color and had the messaging that it's a new look, but the same recipe. This is not true at all, it's different! My dog will not eat it unless he's really hungry (he full blown skipped eating for 36 hours before he would touch the stuff). I thought maybe he had an upset stomach, but this happened again a few different times.He also gets fairly lethargic after eating it too. Almost like digesting it is taking a lot out of him... and he's a 2 and a half year old Border Collie... so that's a big red flag when my Border Collie is low energy.That's not all either... the fish smell is gone. Seriously, not a single hint of fish at all in the smell of the food and I also noticed blue bag one leaves significantly larger residue behind in the dog bowl than the pink bag one did.It's unfortunate because I used Blue Buffalo for years with my previous Husky and for the last two years with my Border Collie and it's been great. But now, I'm on the hunt for a new food for him and cancelled my subscription for this one."
Blue Nose Pit Is Healthy and Loves This Food,My dog & I have a  subscrptn for this product. It is my go-to food for Gus. Gus was a severely abused pit bull; my bestie & my 7th high risk rescue. He has stomach aches & his food won't digest once a month.  He'll start by eating grass on walks & progresses. I will immediately switch his food to BlueBuff for a few days. In those days he will got to the bathroom regular. But he does not like it for an every meal food.
Convenient,Pic above of bandit after eating is new food by blue ✌️🐾🐾🐾❤️ . All good ingredients 🙌
Less poop!!,"I was feeding my dog ""Taste of the Wild"" and he seemed to be enjoying it for the most part. But as weeks progressed I noticed a terrible turn in his stool and his mood. I also noticed he wouldn't eat the food once a put it down, he would leave the food untouched for 2 to 3 days at a time. That's when I started to do more research. I started to compensate with Purina, but that only work for a week or so and it was back to unhealthy stool, lack of eating, downtrodden mood, and even vomiting. I started giving him peeled boiled potatoes, unseasoned white rice, and egg yolk just to put something in his belly. One day I was at home and clear as day I thought ""Blue Buffalo"" I know it was the LORD speaking to me because I had never inquired or researched this specific product. I didn't hesitate, nor did I speculate. I jumped on Amazon and ordered this product which arrived 2 days later. Jackson (my blue nose pit) dove head first into his dog dish leaving no remainings. At first I thought maybe because he really liked it as he does most dog food upon initially trying it. But then I noticed a dramatic change in his stool, in his weight and in his behavior. I waited to see if any bad symptoms would reoccur but nothing happened. Jackson is well and loves his food. 15 pound will last a month and 30 pounds will last 2 months. I still give him the white rice and egg yoke occasionally. Rice puts more weight on him and egg yoke shines his coat something wonderful. Overall, Great dog food. Thank You JESUS and Thanks Amazon"
Blue Buffalo is all I feed my dogs!,"Was very convenient to have this delivered to the front porch.  For anyone that rated the flavor, did you taste it?  I am just taking the dogs word for it."
My dog is very picky and she loved it!,"Here is possibly TMI...my dog started pooping SO MUCH on her old food! It was Kirkland turkey and sweet potato which had been fine for years. Maybe they changed their formula, I dunno. She was going outside to go poop 5 or 6 times a day, minimum. She used to go just twice a day, after breakfast and after dinner. Plus, it was like soft serve ice cream, mushy and hard to pick up. And clearly her bottom was irritated, she was licking it a lot. Super gross, all the way around.So I decided to try this Blue formula. I used to have a cat with health problems that did really well on the Blue brand so trying it for my dog was an easy decision. We started with a 25/75 new/old food ratio and by the time we were 50/50 I noticed a difference. Her poops were more solid and there were less of them. It is day 1 of just this new food now. She has been out to go potty twice, and only pooped right after breakfast, and I am thrilled! Again, TMI but it is harder, drier poop. Easier to pick up and doesn't smell as gross either.Even though it is spendier than the Costco food, ordering thru Amazon was cheaper than any local store's sale price and I love that it came to my door, rather than me schlepping it in and out of a cart, my car and up the stairs to my place. But we are so happy with this food that I dont mind paying more and would gladly schlepp it anywhere!"
Only the best for my pup!,For 10+years blue buffalo has been my absolute go to for my dogs!
The dog likes it,"My dog usually eats Purina. I am aware that is isn't the most natural food...Anyway, after Lady sits still for her ear cleaning she knows that she always gets a treat. We stopped at PetSmart and a sales person came over to pet Lady. Lady totally loves people so she was jumping all over the sales lady and licking her face.Eventually she was like ""you have an awesome dog. What do you feed her?""I said Purina.""That's like the McDonald's of dog food""I said ""I know it's unhealthy but you have no idea how hard it was to find something she would actually eat. If she doesn't like a food she just sniffs her bowl and walks away and she'll starve herself for days. I was feeling like a terrible doggy mom before we found Purina.""""I am going give you a few sample bags of some healthy dog food and I bet you she'll eat them!""Of the three samples, Lady would not eat a single one she would put it in her mouth and spit it back on the floor (2 flavors were Simply Nurish and 1 flavor was Nutro).This story was just to illustrate how hard it's been to find something Lady will eat. A few weeks ago our Vet said that she was getting a little chunky and I've been following the directions on the Purina package to the letter (Lady is 1 year old so she is very energetic and she gets a good amount of exercise and she NEVER gets people food) so he said we needed to switch foods because that was the likely culprit.Tried this Blue Buffalo and she adores it!"
Nut free!,"Quality dog food, excellent price, super quick shipping!  Can't go wrong here!"
Goose loves and great for his skin,I used this for the dog
Great quality,"I guess like a lot of parents, my children have certain chores that they do to help out around the house.  One of my 4 year olds chores (that she actually loves to do) is feeding our dog.  One morning, she fed our dog his name-brand dog food and, mid-munching, our dog turned about and licked our daughter on the cheek.  My daughter immediately broke out in hives.My daughter has lots of food allergies, one of which is peanuts.  Imagine my horror when I looked at our name-brand dog food and realized peanuts were a main ingredient!  I always read food labels to keep my daughter safe, but it never occurred to me that I needed to check the dog's food.  I immediately set about trying to find a dog food that didn't have nuts.  I couldn't find one at our local big-box store.  I got on amazon and found Blue Buffalo!!Blue Buffalo, not only is great for my dog, but it's NUT FREE!  I can let my daughter feed our dog and not worry that she's going to have a severe allergic reaction!  I would buy it just because it's nut-free, but I've been so pleased with the quality of the food and the benefits to our dog as well.  Our dog eats less of this than he did of the name-brand dog food we were buying.  His coat seems shinier.  The *only* disappointment, which really isn't one, is that it didn't ""cure"" my dog's shedding.  (No, we didn't seriously think it would, but there's always wishful thinking.)We happily are repeat customers and this is the only dog food we'd get for our dog!"
High quality dog food,This product has really helped with his itchy skin! One week and the itching has stopped.
She loves it!,SUper dog food...one of the best.  My dog loves it and being 11 years old she still wants to play and romp.  I feed her what I consider excellent products for her health and longevity and I very much prefer this dog food.
A high quality product.,"My dogs love this stuff. I have a Boston terrier and a (wait for it) a Basset-Doodle... Bassetoodle? Basset-poo? Poodle Hound? Well, anyway, she's half Basset Hound and half miniature poodle, making her 100% French, and kind of picky. The food her breeder (I know, hard to imagine what they were thinking) had been feeding her was full of food coloring (and possibly roadkill)... That poor puppy threw up every day until I switched her to Blue Buffalo. My Boston is a little sensitive to wheat, so I needed to accommodate their very different issues if possible. Both of my dogs are seniors now, though I feed them this regular adult dog formula, and very healthy. Amazon tends to have a great price on this product.Here's the reason for only four stars, and not five. The good news -- buying from Amazon means I don't have to drive (28 miles) to a specialty pet supply place, somehow get help to convey a heavy bag off the shelf, cart it through the store and hoist it into my car. HOWEVER, and this might be the only downside, I get it delivered to my PO Box. Both the postmaster and I wish it could be shipped to my front door -- it's super heavy, and neither one of us is all that strong. She refuses to lift it at all. So, I get to drag it through the post office, out the heavy door, hoist it into my car, and unload it myself at the house... In summary, delivery to my front porch would earn this Amazon offering five stars in my book!"
High Quality + Dog Loves It,My dog loves the flavor and her bowel movements are all solid but not dry. Very good for her digestive system. Highly recommend.
My American Eskimo likes it,A high quality product.
My Dog never has had issues,My dog is going on about 15 years old and is 50 pounds. Almost half of his teeth have been removed (see below for why I recommend the small bite formula). I wish I had fed him food of this quality all these years.I made the switch over to Blue Buffalo about a year ago from 
Very convenient,"Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 30-Pound Bag"
No. Just no.,". He gobbled up the chicken and brown rice flavor right away. I noticed the following benefits within the first week of feeding him this:1. Noticeable energy - he is up and running around a little more than usual. He also has a more lively look in his eyes.2. Appetite - his appetite neither went up nor down, but I have noticed that he loves this food. At first he ate about a half to a full cup more than I normally give him, but that tapered back down to his normal amount by the end of the first week.3. Digestion - I have purchased both the regular and small bite pellet sizes, and he digests the small bite pellets better. He has had many teeth removed, so I have noticed that the small bite formula is easier on his gums and teeth.Overall, I highly recommend this food. You pay more for it, but I noticed an immediate difference in my dog's health. To me, that's worth the price. If your dog has had teeth removed, then I also recommend their small bite formula."
Questionable dog food!,He doesn't seem to agree with chicken . He eats the dry food without wet food. Arrived 2 day prime. Will subscribe and save. He has regular business outside and no accidents. Belly doesn't seem upset. Been feeding him this for 5 months. He's 2 years old
He's still eating it.,That it's fish flavor and it's one of the only ones that are. And haven't changed their ingredients since we've bought it
Rancid,It arrives on time and I subscribe so I don’t have to worry about running out of dog food.
Great Item,"1/20/2022Bella (2 year old 30lb lab retriever mix) has been on this food for about a week and I just canceled my subscription and got a refund.My refund note was: Food is causing diarrhea, severe hair loss, itching/biting, loss of appetite, excessive gas, and bad breath in my dog. I've purchased this food from Walmart in the past and didn't get this reaction.I ran out of characters so I'll emphasize more here.At first, I thought the hair loss was because she had a bath last weekend but she's reached the point where her hair is falling out in clumps when she scratches her neck. I'm constantly wiping fur off my face and getting it caught in my nose. It's everywhere.Her poops will start off solid then slowly get softer until they're liquid.Her breath now smells like leaking anal glands.Usually, she'd gobble down all the food as soon as I set it down, but now she'll just sniff it and walk away... She still follows me and constantly jumps up on two legs before I set it down, but now she'll eat her food maybe 5 hours later or eat it in slow increments. She just doesn't enjoy eating anymore.Before this, she transitioned from the local food she had at the humane society to a 6lb pound bag of blue I bought at Walmart and was fine. I wanted a better food that isn't only sold at one local county store. It was $18+ for the 6lb bag so I opted to subscribe to the 15lb bag on here to get a better price, 5% off, then 5% cash back with the Amazon credit card.After reading the reviews I can see I'm not the only one having problems. The Walmart bag didn't do anything to her, but I'd rather not take the risk again even with the store bags. I dug deeper into the bag and didn't see any mold, ants, maggots or even rat skin... that the other reviews mentioned. It smells fine, looks alright, and doesn't expire until 23'.I thought this food would be fine because it had good reviews and decent ingredients. The FDA is currently reviewing grain-free food and foods containing peas and other legumes or potatoes as main ingredients so I steered clear of that. Some of the reviews said this food contains lead so I'll look into that.I'll be transitioning to a new food shortly and update this review afterwards! Do research and keep your babies safe!"
Love Blue Buffalo But...,"I have ordered Blue Buffalo dog food for years, but for some reason this fish and brown rice recipe upset the stomachs of my 3 dogs. All three dogs suffered runny stools we believe from eating this product. We have discontinued feeding this recipe and have since gone back to deboned chicken and brown rice and the dogs are doing well."
My dogs love it,"Well, I guess he likes it because he eats it but it could be because I buy it for him. If he survives this 30lb bag I will give a follow up review.  Can you all tone it down on the life source bits because they are giving my dog a little to much Life. I'm old and cant chase this nut because of these powerful bits!"
Decent dog food,"The doggos seem underwhelmed with this food, and they are not picky. We have a food storage container that seals up well, but this food smells rancid from the get-go. Second time, I won’t be buying again."
Don’t buy from amazon,Great Item
My Dog LOVES Blue Buffalo's Adul Life Protection Formula - but It IS MAKING HIM SICK NOW..,"I love grain free Blue Buffalo food. It really helps with the allergies and the boys love it. My ""but"" comes from the fact it's cheaper to order from Chewey and the orders come within 48 hours. Not a lot cheaper but every penny counts at this point."
Tasteful for my dog,My dogs love it
multiple dogs have issues with this food.,I tried this dog food when I could not get the dog food my dog likes.  My dog is a picky eater and did not care for this food.
great product,Our 2 year old German Shepard has been eating Blue Buffalo since we got her at 8 weeks…and this type for almost a year. I ordered through Amazon because they had a good deal on it and only received 2 bags. The last bag we got from Amazon was just opened a little over a week ago and our dog has not peeing out of her butt since then. We took away food for 24hours for it to stop and then start right back up again after eating this food. I just went to the pet store to buy a regular bag and hopefully it’ll fix this because I’m tired of waking up every two hours to let her poop.
Buyer beware !!! Somethings definitely off.,"I wrote a great review for Blue Buffalo when I first got this kibble. My other dog has the senior version as well.  I noticed that both dogs were licking themselves more and chewing on themselves more. Lots of itching and scratching and more than when they were on their previous dry food.(Each dog was on a different blue buffalo food. VERY ODD!!!)One dog has chewed into the skin on their paw.. the other was started vomiting food.  I noticed that there were more than 40 complaints about this on Amazon..  and that's NOT GOOD.I would not recommend you try this food .. or if you do, buy very small quantities.I am shocked that Amazon didn't notice  all the negatives and that no one in Blue Buffalo heard about it.I will be contacting them too.<<MY OLD REVIEW>>I was concerned about my dog when I switched dog food. He's a picky eater and doesn't always want to eat what's put in front of him.  However,  he loves this Blue  Buffalo kibble for dogs.  When I walk him early every morning, I take a bag of kibble with me because I know he will be hungry. I didn't want to give him treats when we walked.. so I use kibble. He LOVES it. He eats about 3-4.5 oz every single morning.  That's a  lot of dry kibble... and even if he drops some kibble while eating the small handful I gave him, he eats up anything he drops. This Blue Buffalo formula is terrific! (And my dog's coat is shiny, gorgeous and  he's healthy!Considering they had only been on the food for less than 3 weeks, I am going  to ask for a refund. for each Blue Buffalo food type.. and I will be notifying Blue Buffalo.I started each dog on entirely new food and they aren't puking or chewing nearly as much.BEWARE and BE Aware. Read the blue buffalo critical reviews on Amazon"
My dog ate it,My pet likes the food.
Great for my goldendoodle,after a decade+ of dogs testing even the highest quality kibble i'm starting to believe that dog kibble is just low quality cheap slop that is left over from processing other parts for human needs.  yet to find a bullet proof food that can actually help your dog perform at a high level.  randomly bags of this food make my current dogs sick. next.
Happy dogs!,Best food for the $.No more allergy's for my German Shepard.
Shipping mistake,"Let me start off by saying I absolutely love blue buffallo. That being said, I've had this a part of my amazon subscribe and save forever but the last time something was terribly off.Half way into finishing the bag my dog got seriously sick, lost a lot of her hair and even her appetite. She started chewing furiously all herself all over her body and eventually she would smell the kibble and walk away which she never does. At first I thought maybe fleas or mange or something of the sort but after getting her checked out nothing was wrong with her in that sense.I inspected her food and it definitely smelled different than before. I decided to check the reviews on Amazon and saw similar complaints... well I dumped out the entire bag and decided to grab a small bag of the same brand and flavor and what do you know, she ate it like she hadn't seen food in forever.I smelled the new bag of blue buffalo that I purchased from the store and it didnt smell bad at all unlike the one I got from amazon.A few days after feeding her the bag from the store she already had major improvement in her mood and appetite and her hair started growing back. No more biting like crazy either.Needless to say I canceled my amazon subscribe and save and will be getting it from the store from now on. In fact I refuse to buy anything on Amazon that our family ingests or puts on our bodies like lotions and whatnot anymore. I don't know ir its a bad batch or a fake product or what but it's just not worth the risk."
Open product,"My dog ate this food when we put it in his bowl. He also eats his own poop from time to time and once ate a tampon. So the bar is very low, but he seemed to like this better than the poop."
Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula,Great for my goldendoodle
6 dogs… nobody likes it😭,Our dogs enjoy this brand. We frequent this flavor and brand.
"Dogs love it, but bag ripped",Sent wrong size bites.  Need small adult bites.  My 2 dogs are small and missing teeth.  Love the formula and they enjoy it but can’t return these 2 bags.
excellente,The product is awesomeBut unfortunately it was delivered open.Although it’s open in small area I will still not be giving it to my best friend (dog).Please look into this matter.
Love Blue,Great ingredients and my dogs seem to like it.  I have ordered several times and will continue.
Dogs love it!,I have to mix it with their old food to get it used up…one dog seem to get loose stool’s from it… we are finally almost through the bag…won’t buy again.
My dog loves it!,"First time ordering dog food from Amazon. Couldn’t believe the dogs both ate this food dry-they loved it. However, the bag was ripped in the box, causing loose dry food  in box. I don’t know if I will order again from Amazon, but will definitely start using this dog food."
My dog likes it.,como dije fue y es una muy buena election
Blue Buffalo is a high quality dog food!,"I love Blue.  I did not buy it for a long time because I simply could not afford it.  It was outside of my budget.  Now, I simply can't afford to not buy it.  My dog loves it and she always eats and and never wastes it.  Before if she would not eat her dog food because she did not feel good, I would have to throw it away as she would continue to refuse to eat until I got fresh out.  With Blue, it can sit out for a couple of days and she will eat it still.  They have what I need when I need it and I can easily switch from one to another without her going through diarrhea or tummy issues.  This has been a great brand for both my dog and cat and I will stick with it."
WARNING!!!! Caused extreme sickness in my dog,Dogs have been loving it for many years now
Smells like Chicken & ...Blueberries?,She’s always been a picky eater. She gobbles this down like a kid with candy!
Great,My dog likes it so that's the most important thing.
Tasty.,"I bought Blue Buffalo Life Protection dog food to replace the prescription dog food we previously used.  The dog loves it and I can't ask for more.There are many negative reviews out there from several years ago. This all seem to be related to a lawsuit from another company.  Why Amazon keeps showing them I do not know, but they should be taken with a grain of salt."
Always Fresh never expired,"**** EDITED to let everyone know our sweet doggie had to be put to sleep yesterday as she was suffering to greatly. Vet thinks its from mold in her food. ****Our dog right now is on a IV at the vets and they are trying to keep her alive. She has been very sick since consuming the last bag of Blue that came from Amazon two weeks ago....If you read on you’ll find that other dogs and their owners are experiencing the same thing. I really hope that Blue Buffalo will refund our vet bill because they can in no way give our dog her life back if we loose her.I’ve received five emails from Amazon since 6:30 PM last night. I’ll post a picture of that below as to save anyone else from going though what we are.My dog has eaten this exact food for maybe six years without any issues and we always order from Amazon so I’m not certain what happened with this batch. You can also read consumer affairs the reports from the last 2 to 3 weeks about this food to be the same as the complaints here on Amazon. For whatever reason this food is making some dogs very very ill. Are started with vomiting, losing weight, being lethargic and then blood in her stool. Are smaller dog ate about a half of a handful of it and became sick as well, not the food we normally feed him so he was switched back over instantly.....Don’t risk it!!! Of course we tried to call the blue Buffalo number and they won’t be open again for phone calls until Monday and I got that email after they were already closed on a Friday night :(Younger dog may bounce back more quickly but due to my dogs age they aren’t sure she is going to pull through. She has jaundice and her liver is not working properly...She was a perfectly healthy dog before eating this last batch of food."
Too expensive,"I don’t know why, but my dog doesn’t seem to care for the small, black-ish kibble that (I guess) represent dried blueberries. He doesn’t hate them, but he usually avoids them to the extent he can. And my dog is not a picky eater. This is a minor complaint, because he still eats and eats well. And he is very healthy, and my vet agrees.I haven’t tasted the offending kibble myself yet, so I can’t say if they have a particular flavor. But in general I think things in dog food that are engineered to look like other (more appealing) things for the benefit of the owner, not the dog, are unnecessary.Overall, the food really does smell like chicken, which is about as good as it gets, as long as the flavor is “chicken”. I haven’t tried other flavors, but if they all smell like chicken I’ll update my review."
Seems my dogs allergies are lesser with lamb over chicken,Seems to be regulating my dogs system which was pretty irregular with iams. A little pricey but definitely worth it. This bag was pretty fresh.
Great,"Dog like it, but i have to change flavor often."
:),"Was skeptical about ordering dog food online due to not being able to see the expiration date . Thought why not try it and see.  Happy to say there was no problem here, and delivery was fast. No complaints form my pooch."
Highly recommend,"Good dog food, i guess.  My girl seemed to like it ok, but too expensive."
Rat droppings?,Liked it
I like how they ask me about it’s flavor…. It was delicious!,My did like it coming late
Great Product!,Dogs like it
Do Not Buy!!,"After slowly transitioning to this food over the period of a week, I did notice some looser stools just as many other people reviewing this product.  Towards the end of this transition time the stools became normal and it is a dogfood that he loves to eat.  I can't say that the ""lifebits"" that are in the mix is his favorite thing to eat, but most of the time his bowl is clean.  If he leaves anything in his bowl, it would be a few (2-3) of those which is a very small percentage of what was in the bowl to begin with.My dog IS a PICKY eater and with other brands I have often had to add a small treat to his bowl in order for him to eat it all, but I do not have that issue with this brand.  The one thing that I have done is to add some warm water to the bits which makes them softer as well as release the aroma and flavor.  My dog reacts the same way as he would have if I put some gravy on top of his food when I do that.He has gone from walking up to his bowl and looking at me wondering where his ""treat"" is so that he can eat to jumping up on his hind legs, bouncing around excited that he is about to be fed.The only downside I can think of with this product is that just like some other posters pointed out, there was evidence of some loose stool during transition and that the lifebits does not seem to be something that he enjoys eating."
Charlie The Beagle Approves!,"There were these old pebbles in it that didn’t seem to belong. These pebbles look like rats dropping. I didn’t like them in my dogs food so I would pull them out. there was about 1-2 pebbles approximately every scoop of food provided to my dog. Which seems like a lot. Every time I fed her I would go through the scoop and pull them out, unless they were some special vitamin I think blue buffalo should look into this. Other than that, my dog appeared to enjoy the food and also appeared appetizing for my dog."
Great ingredients,He eats it and he seems to be thriving
Best food ever,"I love this Blue dogfood! I have been giving this to my dogs for a few years now and I'm 62 and have had dogs all my life. The quality of this food is outstanding. There are so many dog foods out there that shouldn't be consumed by any animal. I want my 3 dogs to be happy and healthy like we all do and my Labradoodle is 8 and has always been healthy, thank goodness, my mini Aussie is 10 and she is reasonably healthy for 10 as well and I also have a Shih Tzu who is 4 and he very rarely throws up which is common because of there flat noses and I put all this down to this food. They never leave any, they sleep well, they listen, most of the time.....lol  and I put all this down to good nutrition. I want them to live forever like we all do so I believe they need to eat the right foods, no scraps, cause a lot are toxic to them, so I would definitely recommend this food......Thank you 'Blue' you make my doggies happy!!"
He loves it,I couldn't figure out why my dog started losing her hair and having terrible allergic reaction to the only kind of food she has ever ate and when I started buying it on Amazon the problems started. After reading the reviews it makes sense because everyone else is having similar issues.
Buffalo Blue Dog Food,"While I haven't actually fully tasted the food, Charlie the Beagle is always excited after he eats and runs to kiss my face. He really seems to like this food and I think it makes him a happy and healthy dog. The only thing is sometimes he picks out the life source bits. I try to reason with him and say that he needs his healthy life source bits to continue to grow and be a healthy dog, but he doesn't always listen. I included two pics of Charlie Beagle. The one with his mouth open and jumping up is him being happy right after eating Blue Buffalo food. (Doesn't he look happy?) The other picture is of him without his Blue Buffalo. (He kind of looks sad) Pictures say it all!"
BLUE GRAIN DOG FOOD,"Have been buying it for years, extremely happy with freshness, ingredients, and pup loves the flavor."
Om Nom Nom!,"We literally tried 10 different high-quality dog food so far for my dog who has a really sensitive stomach and nothing seemed to work. The Blue Buffalo really did the trick, she never threw up and this is the first one which doesn't cause her diarrhea. Her hair looks shiny and she likes the taste. She is a high energy dog and I had trouble with previous foods because she actually needed way more than it was suggested on the feeding instruction but with BB she needs a less than suggested on the feeding instructions (I always adjust it to her activities, current weight, weather etc).I found the reviews here really concerning. Many people just switch food from one day to the other and then are surprised that the dog gets sick. A few people said the dog had digestive issues for weeks before visiting the vet... I understand that you are disappointed and worried but I don't think the food is the issue in many of these cases. Also not every food is good for every dog,  but it doesn't mean there is anything wrong with Blue Buffalo, just like there is nothing wrong with the X other premium category food that did not work for us."
My dog loves this food.,Dogging loves it
Simply Amazing,Best dog food for my dog. My dog enjoys this flavor the most if I get her the green bag she doesn’t like it to much. She’s been eating this since a baby
my dog likes it,I have two standard poodles and one tiny Yorky. I was buying the tiny Yorky food for the tiny puppies and once she made a-year-old she started eating a large dog food for the standard poodles. She does not like the little round brown dark brown balls in it she picks them out but she loves the food. My big dogs eat every bit of it I have had them on many different kinds of food and they love BLUE!  I highly recommend this food my dogs have done great on it and they changed right over with not having runny stools. Again I had to recommend this food but the one with grain free not the one that’s grain free they have found that grain free is affecting some dogs brains and killing them.  If you prefer to have a grain free food blue also makes that that I feed my dogs the one with the brain and I highly recommend it
Huge bag with a flavor the dogs love,"My dogs are crazy.  I've tried for years to get them to eat high quality foods.  We've done Innova Evo, Wellness, Canidae, Call of the Wild.  They always act like I'm torturing them.  So I would end up feeding them Purina Pro Plan and feeling bad about life.  One day, my husband accidentally purchased a bag of Purina One and then they insisted that was the only food for them.  They decided to bunch Pro Plan in with the health foods and boycott it.One of my dogs is pretty skinny with a very high metabolism, so I can't afford him showing ribs and convincing people I'm not feeding him.  So for a while I gave in, and just mixed a high quality food in with the Purina One and let them pick out the pieces.Anyways, I decided to try Blue Buffalo because I was almost out of food and my car was acting funny and there it was on Amazon Prime... HOLY HELL they love this food!  They just eat it right up, no complaints, no looking back at me expectantly.  They enjoy it even more than they enjoyed their garbage food, and I don't have to feel bad about what I'm feeding them!The ingredients are great, the caloric content is good and pretty dense for my skinny boy, and the kibble size is good for my three sized dogs (XL, Medium, and Small but Fat).I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors and perhaps trying a higher quality Blue Buffalo food, but for now I'm just glad they're eating something decent for once!"
"My dog seemed to like it the first 4 meals, but after that refused to eat it.",My dog will only eat blue branded foods. It is crazy. He loves it so much.
Life source bits - our dogs spit them out.,"Blue Buffalo has been a miracle for us.  When we first got our sweet little girl, she was already two years old and had lived a rough life with not the best care or food.  We were told that she was fed a store brand generic food, which she would gobble down as fast as she could when it was in front of her.  After a few weeks we started having issues with our new family member, it seemed like every other day she was having a seizure which usually occurred a few hours after her food was eaten.  After numerous vet appointments the suggestion was made to give her a better food, so after quite a bit of research we settled on Blue Buffalo.  I am happy to say that we have now had our Baby Girl for 5 years and we have been seizure free since the switch.  I can honestly say you get for what you pay for in this case, she has more energy, her coat looks 100% better, and she no longer gobbles down her food, but enjoys it throughout the day. I highly recommend Blue to anyone that has a dog or cat, its simply one of the best foods on the market.  Thank You Blue for helping our little girl and making her a permanent part of our family."
My dogs love it,i dont like price hike though for only 30lbs
good product,"This. Bag. Is. HUGE!!When we saw this box on our doorstep, we had no idea what it was - maybe a table, huge cutting board, or a piece of furniture? As the owner of two small dogs, we had never gotten a really big bag of dog food before.Enter the Blue Buffalo mega bag! We felt like we were dog owners with a Saint Bernard when we opened up the box and saw this giant bag of fishery for the pups. The dogs had really been enjoying Natural Balance dry dog food that was fish and sweet potato flavor, but it was a little too pricey. We switched to Blue Buffalo gradually and the pups love it just as much, if not more!One of our dogs used to eat wet food, but he really loves Blue Buffalo products even more. It's been substantially easier for us and it's been a lot better for his teeth to eat dry dog food. The wet, raw food he had been eating was leading to a lot of tartar build up and we're really happy that we have him on a food that he likes that's good for his teeth. They've tried the Blue Buffalo chicken flavor as well, but I think the fish is where it's at.For our two dogs (9 lbs and 20 lbs), this mega bag will easily last us months! We love Blue Buffalo products!"
Picky pups but they like this product!,"My dog seemed to like it and the contents of the food seemed to be very good.  She ate it eagerly the first 4 meals then refused to eat it.  I added Blue Buffalo canned food and she ate eagerly for 3 meals, then refused to eat it again. She IS a very picky eater!"
Excellent,"Our 3 dogs only eat the kibble part of the food and leave the life source bits on the floor, where we often step on them on accident and it makes a mess. But maybe your dog will love this food!"
My dog is highly allergic & so far it's alright!,"I was turned on to this food by a rescue organization and figured they knew what they were doing … my dogs eat the fish and brown rice flavor. If dogs could talk, I could tell you all about freshness and flavor … but seems to keep their attention!"
Good Deal,dogs like it-quick delivery and reasonable price
Quality and flavor,Nice small size morsels
.,Excellent
This may give your dog Montezuma's revenge,My dog do like this product.
AMAZING,Good Value
Dogs like it but......,Lamb flavor
Dog loves ❤️,Love the benefits of blue buffalo dog food and dogs love the taste I just wish there were not as small bites even in the large breed there is tiny little kibbles
Rottweiler Approved,"I have two dogs and I like to change up their food so it's not the same ole same ole. I decided to buy this Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula because it has quality ingredients but it gave my dogs the runs. To be fair the bag does say to transition your dog over to this food slowly. Well, I didn't read that part until after I noticed the dogs had Montezuma's revenge. This dog food is made with higher quality ingredients than other foods. The dogs seem to like it just fine. Just read the bag before starting off with this or you could be cleaning up some very messy poops."
Great food for dogs  Blue is all we ever buy. Spend a lil more to keep your pets healthy,"My dog changed. Her coat is so wonderful and shiny, sheds less. She filled out. Goes out less. Calmer. All by food? Wont shop in WM for dog food ever again AMAZING RESULTS. Worth the money for the health of my dog."
Fast and easy delivery,"My dogs really liked this food. We would add some warm water to it and they would munch it down. Our 2 large dogs and 4 small dogs ate the food and their fur and skin was much healthier. We had all our dogs and cats changed to BB in about Nov. so it has been almost 3 months. We now have decided to change food because our dogs and cats stopped using the potty regularly. Just a few days ago we took one cat to the vet and she had a UTI combined with swollen/inflamed bowels. Never had we had problems before, until BB. I didn't want to wait until any of my other cats or dogs got sick so we just threw out all the BB food. I had read the bad reviews here on amazon but I didn't think that such a well known brand of food could be bad. I figured the reviews were probably just lies to try and sway people to another brand, or that maybe it was just a coincidence that certain pets got sick-not because of BB. But now I saw for myself that although this food is good, it is actually too good; its not balanced which can cause issues in the animals. Do research on BB before you decide whether its the right fit for your animals."
My picky eater likes it.,My St Bernarn Boxer Mix loves this dog food
Dogs love it,"Since I rescued my Rottweiler, I changed his food to this and it has helped his coat and his weight dramatically. I have fed it to him for the last two years that I have now had him, and he is doing wonderful. I highly recommend blue buffalo"
Good dog food,Blue dog food is all I buy
Freshness,Love this dog food - and my dog loves it as well
Very good dog food for your animals,It’s been hard to find a food that the picky eater and the larger dog can agree upon. This seems to be a good compromise for them both.
Good food,Have 2 older dogs. This got them down to their correct body weight. Vet very happy & told me this is great stuff.
Wish it included salmon,Dog food
"My dog loves it, can’t vouch for the flavor (haven’t tried it)","This food is causing my dog a lot of diarrhea according to the vet, even though the food is not expired, he tells me that it must be damaged, they prescribed another type of food"
My dog loves it!,Have no issue with the dog food very good for your pets
My dog loves it.,We always feed this.
Doesn't taste like chicken!,"OK, we all know times are tough and inflation is causing everybody to cut corners. But this tastes nothing like chicken.Meals for my family can get extremely expensive. Like every other hard working American I've been looking for a little filler to stretch our suppers out and save a few bucks. My family owes a lot to Purina. They have gotten us through tough times before. But now that my wife got promoted to weekend manager at Hardees we were looking to upgrade to a more classy supper.This Purina tastes nothing like chicken. We first tried it on Taco Tuesday but it made the tacos taste bland. The next day we tried the Purina with potatoes and green beans but Purina just soaked up the gravy and got soggy. It didn’t even make good gravy stock. Disappointing. The final straw was our tater tot hotdish. I used the Purina instead of hamburger but again it just soaked up the cream of mushroom and got soggy.The only saving grace is that my five year old enjoys Purina with chocolate milk for her morning cereal. Unfortunately, it’s going to take her a year to eat through a 50 pound bag, which I don’t mind, but the mice keep going in the bag stealing some kernels. Who has time to flick off mice poop every meal? We have been letting her eat her Purina cereal for all three meals but that’s not healthy for a growing kid either.Added bonus…….My daughter's hair looks amazing after a month of eating Purina cereal. Her long brown hair shines and flows like a donkey's mane. She looks like a young Nancy Reagan.For those of you with teenage daughters, feel free to check out my review for Fancy Feast Natural Trout and Tuna. My 16 year old started eating a can for lunch and supper for two months and she looked amazing in her prom dress."
Purina Pro Plan with Probiotics!,I buy this for my dog who is about 13 years old. He is not usually picky and he likes this food a lot. He has some issues with sore joints at his age and with the probiotics and other ingredients in this food it seems to help with his joints. This food is better than what I gave him before.
Amazing product,Received this product today while putting it in the containers my dogs came up and couldn’t keep their mouths out of the container trying to eat it I gave him a little sample and they kept coming back for more and more even my cats were begging for some reading the reviews I see there’s problems with this have to keep my eyes open but so far so good
Product is fine - delivery stunk.,"Our dog really loves this food.  My only gripe is the delivery person left it outside about 100 yds from our house.  It's a heavy bag and if it would have rained while we were not home, the whole bag of food would have been ruined.  I was generous to give it four stars but I don't want to give the manufacturer a bad rating since the product is good.  If the delivery issue is not resolved, I will be cancelling my recurring order."
My dogs love it,Bought because of the healthy ingredients. We have dogs from 35 pounds down to 5 pounds and they all love the taste. One of our dogs is a finicky eater and she loves the taste of this food. My dogs seem to not have any issues with the size texture or digestion. I recommend this food. The price is not issue for us as we want our dogs to have a healthy choice of food.
My dogs love this food!!!,"This came highly recommended by my vet, and I agree that it's a great product. All the essentials my dogs need, and they love the taste! Highly recommend."
Vet recommended and it’s soft on sensitive tummies.,Like that I can trust food.  USA made is a plus we’ll no it’s mandatory for my group.
My dogs have always looked great on Proplan,My dogs have loved Proplan since I first started buying it in 1985. I’ve tried other premium food but always come back to Proplan.
My dogs love it!,My dogs love it!
Good for pet,"This is a good food, it has alot of natural ingredients in it."
Picky dogs loved it,Have a really picky husky couldn’t keep her nose out of the bag. Don’t quote me on it but I think there’s actual chicken in the kibble? Looks like it’s maybe freeze dried. The dogs couldn’t get enough of what ever it is.
Woof woof,"Well I didn't eat it personally but my dogs did so according to them, woof woof"
A little pricey,A little pricey/ how ever it is a good middle of the road food for my dog. It isn’t the cheapest- poor quality and not the most expensive- high  quality …. It’s in the middle. My dog loves the chucks of chicken in it.
Great food,Very convenient to have it auto ship. My dog loves it
Something's changed and it's NOT GOOD!!!,I have been using this brand of dog food for 20 months.  Something has changed!  I have 3 dogs.  Had to take one to the vet for vomiting & diarrhea.  Two days later another dog is sick with vomiting & diarrhea.  Today third dog is having diarrhea.  It has to be the dog food.  I will be contacting Purina as this is a new bag that was opened & the cost is $80.  So far I have $420.00 in vet bill for one dog.  I'll need to call my vet about the other two and who knows what this will cost me in the end.  Purina Pro Plan you made my dogs sick!!!  Do something before other dogs are sick too.
Purina Pro Plan Dog Food,I normally feed this brand and formula.  The kibble size is just right for all the dogs to manage.  This had gone way up in price since I first purchased it but is still cheaper than retail stores.
55lb pound dog-47 lb bag lasts 3 months,Our Pitty Mix loves this food and we were able to save some money by subscribing.  One bag lasts us about 3 monthd (she’s gets 2 cups of food a day).
The choice for both my dogs!,"I switched to Nutro to save money and take advantage of a deal and paid the price! Both dogs wouldnt eat it, threw out bowls of uneaten kibble night after night.  Both started easting grass like crazy and my puppy began itching all over.  I went back to Proplan and threw out the Nutro!They both licked their bowls clean the first night and every night since!  My puppy will eat the kibble without any wet or chicken added.  That speaks volumes!Thank you for making a great product Purina, amidst the pandemic where most companies are finding ways to cut corners!"
Better price than TSC,My dog had no complaints!
Shipped on time,Dog food shipped on time.I didn't know our farm store sold the same thing for the same price. No savings.St Bernard loves the food.
Bowels are normal not loose,"As of. Ow I liked it better because bowels are normal instead or loose running. Also, She doesn’t fart or burp as much."
Recommended by my vet,I’ve been using Purina Pro Plan for several years. My dog began licking his paws a lot and  I read that the probiotic brand often reduced the licking and it certainly did in his case. I would certainly recommend it.
Shipping - box crrushed,Product shipped too large of a box - mine was crushed in all over and torn open with small pierced hole in bag.  Use of a more suitable size box would be a solution.  GREAT PRODUCT
Good quality food,"My fur babies love this brand. They prefer the lamb and rice blend, but that's been impossible to find lately."
Dogs love it,My dog wasnt wanting to eat their previous food anymore. We switched and now she loves this food.
My dog loves it,My vet recommends the is brand and my dog has never had any issues with it.
Best food I’ve had,We usually eat this 3 nights a week for dinner i sometimes mix it with cream of mushroom soup me and my girlfriend love it !
"Great Food, but messy","Food was one of those recommended by my vet because the nutrition is science based (not just based on what consumers think is best for their dog). My pup loves it, I love seeing dehydrated pieces of real chicken in there, but I have an issue with all the crumbs in it from those dehydrated bits. I use a good portion of my dog's daily food for training and while the kibble is great, obviously crumbs are not suitable for this. My pup is very smart and needs a lot of mental stimulation, so she gets her dinner in puzzle feeders to make her work for it and keep her entertained - the crumbs from this food get everywhere as she is working on her puzzles. I have been sifting the food to make sure all the small bits get into her bowl where they are more contained rather than into the puzzles, but I don't like having to take that extra step every day, so unfortunately this is not the food for us and we need to try something else."
It's dog food for my lady (Her name is lady),"for a 47 lb bag this is actually a good price. Got here faster than I expected too. I had gotten a 20 lb bag from the food store for my dog just to hold her over til I could get a bigger bag and that 20 lb bag was around the same price as this one which was ridiculous. But my dog loves this stuff I always try getting different flavors for her to test out to see which one's she's willing to eat and which one's she's not as fond of. I just got her a year ago rescued her from a breeder who was abusive towards her. He only gave his dogs one type of food and wanted me to pay him 80 dollars for the food which is a brand I never even heard of.She is much happier here getting her pets and loving she may be a cane corso(italian mastiff) but acts like a lap dog. I've been buying her beds,treats, all of it that she more than likely never had there. Because most breeders are very strict with their dogs about what they eat and he had her outside in a kennel which probably didn't have heating or anything. (the dude was amish and really into how to do thing's the old way aka no electric, etc.She is a good protector though she see's a random cat run passed the door or squirrel she loses her mind and barks and jumps all over. She is a sweetheart even though all she's been through. She's a big puppy inside."
A Good Dry Dog Food,The hydrated chicken pieces are plentiful and the spaniel loves them. this was also recommended by the vet too
loves the chicken bites,"I am a picky labradoodle but I like this dry dog food because it's like there are little treats in it, and then the other stuff sneaks into my mouth."
The Shredded chicken is what your dog will love.,"The shredded chicken mixed in with the dry kibble makes this an excellent choice for picky eaters. We were struggling to find a dry food that our dog would actually want to eat. This food was a game changer. Our pup went from turning his nose up at other foods to now happily enjoying his mealtimes. It's a good qualify food with essential vitamins and minerals, probiotics and glucosamine.I am not affiliated in any way with the seller or brand. This is my own personal review and recommendation. 😊"
Dogs love it.,Funny that one of the questions in the review is flavor.  I have to trust my dogs on this answer. I asked and the both told me it tasted good.  They then asked if they could have ice cream since they cleaned their plates. I can't argue with that.
My dogs love it.  Can't wait until meal time.,My dogs have shiny soft fur and don't itch or scratch.They get so excited when it's time to eat.
My dog’s favorite,Pro Plan was recommended by our trainer many years ago and it’s the only brand we feed. Our boy is a picky eater but he likes this food and he’s 12 yrs old and fortunately super healthy so we think this food is the best.
Purina pro plan,"Purina pro plan,todo esta excelente sabor,frescura mi nieta perrita preciosa le gusta,lo qu no me gusto es que dejaron la funda abajo de mi edificio y no la subieron arriba dónde vivo"
Very crumbly,"Food is probably very good, but makes a mess when you put it in a treat toy because it’s so crumbly.  Also, I have to pick out the bigger irregular shaped bits because they don’t come out of the toys easily."
Our dog's favorite,Our dogs love this food and have been maintaining a good healthy weight.
Doggy loves it,"My dog is picky, he actually enjoys this food and it is vet recommended. Purchased on Amazon due to tractor supply being out of stock of it over last few months"
Allergy,We have always used the Purina Pro plan for our dogs since they were small.  I read about this probiotics and shredded chicken product and thought it worth trying even though it's pricey!  We got 3/4 thru the bag and my Golden retriever started to chew and lick so much that he began to get raw hot spots.  I can't say this will happen to all dogs. but my two dogs had a terrible itching situation that sent me to the Vet for the hot spots from licking and itching.  I think this product should be reviewed by Purina and see what is causing the itching to prevent this situation in the future.
Not sure about the flavor but the dog seems to enjoy it!,Dog eats this well.
Tasty!,I really enjoy this food either by itself or with milk. It’s both crunchy and savory. Perfect start to the day!
"Switched from higher-end brands, dogs happier and healthier","Over the last few decades we have always fed our dogs high-end dog foods like Taste of the Wild, Canidae, Orijen, etc. However, we would also regularly have digestive issues (diarrhea, constipation, loudly burbling stomachs, bloat, etc), and we would end up doing things like supplementing with pumpkin, vet visits, and other measures.We recently moved and got a new vet, and took one of our dogs in with one of their regular digestive issues. The vet said, look, these high-end foods are usually great, however by their nature they don't have stable suppliers of their esoteric ingredients, so their formulations tend to vary from batch to batch, and a varying diet is a primary contributor to dog digestive issues.After he said this I expected him to push Science Diet, which is what virtually all my past vets have done, and he had bags of it stacked on shelves in his waiting room - but he didn't. He said, try Purina Pro Plan, it's high-end enough to have quality ingredients, but mass-market enough to have stable suppliers and consistent composition over time.We were skeptical, but figured it was worth a shot, so we transitioned our dogs to Purina Pro Plan, and sure enough, their digestive issues have almost completely disappeared. They also remain happy, active, and healthy, with good coats, and don't have lethargic bouts of growling tummies on a regular basis. Note that we have a pretty diverse canine population, ranging from Corgies to mutts to hounds to Rottweilers, and it's worked great for all of them.We did this a few months ago and things are still good, so we're convinced. It still drives me nuts that grocery stores won't carry (what we consider to be) decent dog food, so we have to go to the feed store or PetSmartCo for the Pro Plan, and occasionally I'll buy it here on Amazon (and they ship it Prime, which is nice).Note that we love our dogs and would happily pay more for consistent, high-quality dog food, but we just haven't found it, and we are surprised converts to Purina Pro Plan."
My dog likes it,My dog really likes it so I will keep buying it. My vet says Purina is a brand I can trust. Wish it was a little less expensive but it’s far from the most expensive dry food.
Pleasing to my pups palette,"My pup loves this flavor. We were feeding him the lamb flavor before and he would eventually finish his food but with this flavor, he is so excited for meal time and finishes his food."
Dogs seem to like it.,"Dogs have no problem eating it up, seems to be made from pretty decent ingredients."
Excellent Customer Service,"I am new to amazon prime and have been very impressed with my experience thus far. I have ordered several items and am amazed how quickly things arrive to my home which is in a town of 4000 people. I have an 8 year old 100-lb golden retriever and have been using purina pro plan for his entire life. Today I received my second delivery of this dog food through Amazon and unfortunately it had a slit in the side of the bag from what appears to be a box cutter that resulted in the dog food being all over the inside of the box. This was the first item I’ve received from Amazon that was damaged and not having a ton of experience with Amazon as well as being frustrated that the dog food arrived in this condition, I went to the chat function for customer service to tell them my experience. The customer service was extremely fast and remediated the situation in less than a minute much to my surprise. Very impressed with Amazon’s customer service and their business model. Upon receiving the package today, I was skeptical in ordering further dog food from Amazon but this quick and essentially effortless experience with customer service renewed my newfound trust in such a great company that takes care of their customers with little to no questions asked. Highly recommend anyone considering not lugging around heavy dog food bags anymore to give Amazon a try given their competitive prices and excellent customer service able to remediate any issues that are unlikely to come your way."
Dog Food,"Great, price is a little high"
Making my dog sick,"Started mixing this with my dogs old food with the plan to have him eat this moving forward, but after he started eating pro plan, he has been getting sick every day. Switched him back to his old food and seems to be doing fine."
My fur baby loves this!,My fur baby loves this food! Been using it for years!
My dog LOVES it,I feel sooo guilty. My dog is 5 years old and has never been one to get excited for meal time. Now that I have purchased this food she begs for breakfast and dinner!! My only regret is not finding and buying this sooner. 10:10 recommend!!
My dog loves this!,"There are a lot of dog food brands and styles that my dog likes, but the food doesn't like him.  We have had bouts of vomiting and lack of ability to control when he had to ""go"" resulting in house cleaning that interrupted plans. Any dog owner can attest that most dogs are very sensitive, not being able to vary their diets much. This food was one of the few that didn't give him problems when we moved him to it, although we did a SLOW and GRADUAL conversion, mixing it with his other food (the other food was a very cheap brand that is great on the budget, but he did not appear to be healthy or happy about it).Now, during the conversion process our dog began to sort his food, eating just this brand and leaving the original brand in the dish. He loves it, and is excited to get this food.  And he knows when the box is for him. Sort of ironic because we do not control his diet, the food is in a self feeding container that lasts a week or two at a time....he has no need to wait or be excited for it as he always has it available. However, he loves it...and does get excited. And best yet, his fur is no longer dry and breaking, and he is full of more energy.  Not so good when we don't go out often, but better for him to be healthy and energetic.Of note, do not buy large amounts of this unless you have a way to safely store it.  It does not need refrigerated or anything fancy, but when opened and exposed to the air you have about a month to use it or it starts to cause upset stomach issues in the dog.  I use a dog food container with a gamma seal for the bulk of the food so the food doesn't just sit in the air. I think it is the ""fresher"" meat that is included with the hard bits of corn and fiber.  It doesn't rot, per se, but it does cause issues with your pet."
Very INCONSISTENT product. Switched to other e-merchant.,"I keep buying this product but it is highly inconsistent.First batch food was great. The dry chicken pieces were big, smell was so good and food was fresh, moist and my basset and maltese went thru like maniacs.Second batch, was so different that I had to double check whether I ordered the same thing. Smell was chemical, chicken pieces small and super dry. Two 4-legged mutineers at home, really unhappy.Third batch, food was moist, chicked smaller and smaller. Food smell was better than 2rd batch. I found A LOT of crumbles from the kibbles in the sac. Dogs were more interested in the food this time.I am rolling the dice in 2 weeks hoping my dogs will keep eating ProPlan."
Better $$ than Chewy,Title says it all..today any way.
Only food my dog will eat,"I rescued a high-maintenance shelter dog who only ate hot human food. I tried a few different dry foods and he wouldn’t eat for days. This is the only on he chowed down so I stuck with it. One year later and my dog is energetic, healthy and happy."
My dog loves it,My dog loves it! But I payed double ordering thru AmazonI can buy it at Walmart for half the priceLive and learn
I’ve seen the reviews,"I know this food has some pretty yucky reviews in terms of freshness. While I have experienced issues of freshness when buying from my local Petco, this has not been the case when purchasing from Amazon. convenient shipping and always fresh for me."
Transitioned from Focus puppy to this,"Small breed puppies were on this same Purina Chicken and Rice in the puppy food.  Time to transfer, I chose this.  They transitioned just fine.  The kibble for the ""small breed"" puppies was really too small for our mini fox terrier (even though he is still only 5-6 pounds) and too small for our chi-chi.  So we went with the regular.  Avoided the ""small breed"" this time too, and it is fine."
Like it,My dog does not miss a beat when she eats this seems to keep her healthy
Good quality kibble that doesn't kill breath,My Golden loves her kibble and I try to switch up flavors for her.  This is my favorite for her because it doesn't leave her breath smelling like dead fish.
Best dog treats,Best dog treats ever.  I’m dog is picky about what she eats.  I found these at a local store and she loves them.  I’m so glad that I found them online.
The shredded parts become very crumbly,The formula agrees with my dog's digestive system really well. But the shredded parts are very crumbly. About 1/8 or more of the package is just crumbs. It works ok if you use the crumbs in a stuffed Kong but I hand feed most of my  dog's meals (for training) and it's no good for that.
Dogs love it!,I’ve been trying all kinds of dry food is for my babies. My mother in law sent two bags of this over and my dogs love it. Smells great and is just right for my little one to eat . If you have a finicky eater try this!!!
Best price with free prime shipping.,Used to buy this at PetSmart for my pooch but price kept going up.  Found this on Amazon at a better price with free prime shipping and get it in 2 days.  Appears to be fresh each time.
Great Brand Of Dog Food,My dog loves this stuff. My Veterinarian toldMe about it and some others to feed her. I had her on Nutro but it is on the list of dog foods online that can possibly cause heart problems in dogs. That’s when I switched. I had seen it and heard of it before and just started her on this brand since that was the first brand that the doctor told me about. I get it on here along with the cans. I had a few cans left over from the last bag I had purchased. She will even eat this dry without some of the canned in it. She’s kind of picky too. I’ll stick with this is the weight maintenance formula. She did great with that one. My dog is medium sized. She is a Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. The hard food is medium sized bites. You may want to purchase smaller bites if you go with this brand and have a smaller dog. I added 5 stars for the taste but I didn’t taste it. I wanted her to have it all to hersel but she told me it is delish! 😉
Our dog Sarge loves it,Sarge is a big German Shepard dog with an appetite to match. He likes the taste. The large bags make it easy to always stay on top of things.
Fountain of youth.,"Greatest diet change for my dog. 10 year old (retired) competition hunting English Setter. Has a new bounce to his step. Highly recommend. I was feeding him pro plan high protein and he was declining noticeably after running in the field.  A soft tissue injury from 5 years ago seems to have been eliminated when it had previously prevented him from jumping into the truck. I was very suspect about the diet change but I have seen nothing but positives after changing to this. Highly recommended, I wish I had made the switch earlier."
"My dogs usually love this, but...","I've been feeding this to my dogs for over a year now, and they really loved it. I did a lot of research before I switched their food, so I was pleased that they were eating such a high quality food. For the last few months, though, I've had to coax them to eat. It looks a bit different to me, too - there don't seem to be as many shreds in it as there were when we first started using it. The only time they will reliably eat it is if I mix it with something else, which I don't do often, and one of the dogs actually picked out the food I had mixed in (Fresh Pet) and spit the Purina on the floor. I really hate to switch them to another dog food because they were doing so well on this before, especially because it is so reasonably priced. I'm hoping it is a temporary change in the formula or something."
Amazon to the rescue for this!,My two year old goldendoodle LOVES this specific flavor of purina pro plan. Our regular subscription service was completely out in every size and it was not communicated to me until we were almost out. Amazon to the rescue and we had the food the next day!
Dog can’t review,If my dog could review himself I would be rich  freshness and brand trust important for me.
Quality dog food,2 Labs..Best ingredients
"Great Quality, Good Value","I like Purina Pro Plan because my Boxer & chihuahuas like it & it is a good value. The quality ingredients keep them healthy with no allergy symptoms.Purina has a good reputation for quality products & I have never had to worry about a recall. My two chihuahuas will even eat it, although the kibble is large. (All three dogs are somewhat picky eaters.) I also usually mix this food with chicken broth or chicken bone broth, a small amount of shredded cooked chicken, and an expensive freeze-dried raw beef “topper” made by TruPet/TruDog called, “Fortify Me.” I’ve had them on this regimen for about 2-3 years.The chihuahuas are 7 years old, and the boxer is 4. (Fortunately, he tolerates the little yappers pretty well considering his dominant nature. 😬)"
Great for our dogs!,"My sister has two larger dogs, a Australian Shepard and a Golden Retriever. They are really active and eat a lot.I just got my own Shih Tzu and opted to buy this dog food on her recommendation. It is not grain free, but she told me that some grain-free dog foods have been known to cause health issues in dogs. Given that my dog will be fine eating small amounts of bread, and seems to love rice, I thought I would give this one a go.The instructions recommend a transition period between the dog's old food and new food. Because I was nearly out of old food, I just went straight to this one, and added a little bit of salmon oil. Though I am sure he would prefer to eat people food, he really likes this combination. I buy the chicken one, but my sister buys the lamb one for her dogs as one of them has severe allergies."
Good Choice for Dogs of All Sizes,"This has been the only dog food we have fed our 11 year old lab- her whole life. She’s in amazing shape for her age, always gets compliments on how puppy like she is, and how soft she is- and I  wholeheartedly believe it starts with this quality food we feed her."
The perfect dog food!,"My pup has been eating this food for several years now.  She has always been very fond of it and eats it with no problems.  When I purchased this bag, I noticed that she was not eating it.  Upon closer evaluation of the food, it appears that there are very little if any of the chicken pieces.  This just leaves the pellets.  She will not eat it without the chicken pieces.  Very disappointed."
Where’s the Chicken Pieces?,I have 2 very picky eaters and I am so glad I tried this one because they both like it and will eat it without having to add any wet food! I’m not crazy about the poultry by-product meal but until I can find something more natural I will stick with this one.
Dogs approved,"He has been on Pro Plan Sport since he outgrew puppy food. It was the only thing I could find in a hi performance food that didn't give him terrible gas. Now that he's older and not as active, I switched him to this. His entire life, it has taken him at least 24 hours to eat his daily ration of Sport and then he would carry it all over the house to eat a mouthful at a time when he felt like it. It also gave him fish breath that would take your breath. The Savor, now that is a different story. He stands at the bowl as soon as it hits the floor and doesn't move from it until the bowl is empty. He worries me to death in the  evenings wanting to be fed now. I don't really see any difference in his energy level, hair quality, shedding, no allergies... but on the plus side, no bad breath and no gas either!"
My 8 year old Drahthaar loves it,"A year ago I purchased my very own full blooded Doberman. Made sure she was full blooded with the proper paperwork and everything! When you think about purchasing a pet. You're committing yourself to having this companion as your best friend at home for hopefully 10 years plus! And if you decided to get a pet friend, don't you think you would want to make sure she is happy and healthy throughout her life as well? Well ever since I've started my Doberman on this brand, She runs to the bowl which means she absolutely loves it! And I do feel that this product is keeping her very healthy and lean muscle! And now my new guest to the house is a stray Cat and knowing how well its doing for my dobie, I had to have it for my new kitten! He's on the Focus currently until he ages a little more of course. But he has nothing but joyful fun around the house. Literally can't wait to get his hands on it and stuff his face lol Damn wizard somehow opened my cabinet and nip picked at the bag until he realized that these Purina packaging is top notch. He still has his front claws and and he couldn't tear it thank god! But I would suggest this product to anyone as it has only brought me more joy knowing my pets have well nutrition and happy life styles. And absolutely love eating it! Forgot to mention really keeps their coat/fur very healthy and soft!"
I want the best for my pet and this is it!,"I’ve been buying Purina Pro Plan for years and my dog loves it and his coat is beautiful. However, my last order had an issue. This bag was infested with silverfish.. I didn’t notice at first and almost everyday I’d find a few silverfish running around where I keep my food. My assumption is there was a problem where the food itself was stored. This was the only time I’ve had this issue but just wanted to bring it to light. I usually buy the dog food at Petsmart and had never had this issue at Petsmart."
Infested with Silverfish,Product showed up open and taped shut😔
Bag was ripped open,"I have quite possibly the pickiest French Bulldog known to man!  I’ve tried countless food brands, all of the “artisanal” local brands, raw diet, home cooking, and my little buddy always gets bored or doesn’t like it.  I came across this Purina pro plan at the recommendation of a friend who’s vet said the quality is great.  I was shocked when my dog ate the entire bowl in a matter of seconds.  He’s done this before, but by the 2nd or 3rd day he usually becomes bored and picky.  I’ve been feeding him this food for several months now, and he still devours every meal.  I am really thankful for this food, because meal time use to be a struggle every day with my dog.  I do wish I were supporting local less known organic food brands instead of purina, but if he loves it and vets recommend it, I am ok with continuing!"
Even the pickiest dog loves it,I normally buy my dog food from chewy but to get free delivery I must spend $50 which requires me to purchase something I don’t have to haveI read prior reviews some giving 5 stars some only one so I thought I would give it a try.  My dog loves it and I store my dog food in a container in a open carport and have had no issues. This food has some rather large chunks in it that I use as treats.  The only problem with it is my dog likes it to much and is always wanting more.
My dog loves it,"I usually use science diet for my dog since when I first got him he needed to gain weight. However after a month or so, he wasnt excited to eat it and just would leave the bowl full of food all day but just love and beg for treats. I reduced his feedings, as well changing the times just incase that was a factor. I ended up having to add beef broth so he would eat it.I wanted to find a food with the same nutritional content as well as something that tasted good for him. He loves it, they have different forms of the kibble, as well as more than just one plain flavor so I can switch it up on him easily. Plus its a little cheaper than science diet which is really nice"
Dog Loved it great taste and nutritional value,"My dog Absolutely loves this flavor of Purina Pro Plan. I’ve been feeding him another variety of Purina Pro Plan for about 8mths now, but recently he became extremely ill with some kind of gastrointestinal sickness. He was pooping and vomiting blood, and I thought that I was going to lose him. Luckily, after $500 at the vet, he made a full recovery. While going through this whole ordeal, my vet recommended that I give him probiotics, so I decided to search for a dry dog food that contained probiotics. I was thrilled when I discovered that the brand of dog food that I was already feeding him carried a variety containing probiotics. I bought this shredded chicken variety, and like I said earlier, he absolutely loves it. I will definitely continue to feed him this variety of Purina Pro Plan unless he’s runs into some unforeseen issue with it in the future. Thank you Amazon and thank you Purina."
Probiotic WIN,"It was not fresh, lots of crumbs. The product was supposed to have shredded chicken mix, however it had little to none. My dog was very hesitant to eat and normally eats it enthusiastically?"
"It was not fresh, lots of crumbs",Our dog loves this food so much that we have to use one of the special bowls that helps him take longer to eat.
Our dog loves his food,"I struggled for years to find kibble my dog Suke got excited to eat, she would never eat at scheduled meal times and the food would sit in her bowl until she was starving, I had to add boiled chicken or bone broth every time. I tried all the expensive brands and bought a small bag of this one day when my scheduled delivery was late and we ran out, she loved it from the start and still gets excited for mealtime a year later. It was not a good fit for my other dog who has a sensitive stomach so he gets a different Purina Pro kibble."
My picky eater loves it!,It never gets old. I love having this on auto ship
Feeding my digs the same for more than 10 years,"If you give a crap about what your Pupper eats but can't afford raw or super elite this is 100% where to go. My last dog the salmon pink bag is ALL she could eat. Anything else she'd have a reaction of some exciting sort. My current dummy eats non stop. Feeding him only the excellent stuff would literally break me. I mix this with a grain free top of the line stuff and he's satisfied and healthy without me taking out a loan for dog food 🙄. Its healthy and gives them what they need without the junk. My dummy is a spoiled athletic prince but my ""beginning adulthood dog"" was healthy for a long time on this. When I needed help with my now baby's diet this was an easy choice."
Great option!,"As far as quality I choose Purina over other brands because with a little research its easy to see that many brands are not much more than a name attached to cheap or worse, dangerous, non-USA crap wrapped in fancy branding. My vet agrees so we go with the well know name of the food that have been feeding animals for decades. As far as acceptance our experience has been as follows:  I had been buying Purina Small dog Chicken with strips for my 1 year old Morkie and 1 year old HavaPoo and they LOVE IT The Havapoo inhales it and the dainty Morkie guards and slowly eats her share as the Havapoo tries for seconds. My wife suggested that we change things up because they ""might be getting bored"" of the same thing. Well, they are definitely less eager to the lamb or chicken without the strips flavor so the moral of the story... don't fix it until they wont eat it."
Both my dogs Love Purina but they didnt like Lamb flavor or the Chicken without strips,He eats it
My dog loves this,They don’t eat any other brand!
My Great Danes love it,Lazer loves this food!!! I am glad Amazon carries it. Always speedy delivery
Fast delivery,My dog literally drools when I go to scoop this.PPP is a high quality kibble I suggest to anyone. My dog was on purina one for awhile but after doing research I did the swtich. Her eyes have never been bright and her coat and never been shinier. Plus because it's high quality I use less. One bag lasts my 85 lb mutt for about 2 months. Buy this if you care about giving your dog the best but also have a budget to keep to. You dont need to spend 80 dollars on food to have a beautiful and healthy dogAdded pic of how my dog looks after two months on PPP
Best kibble you can buy,"ROSCOE’S REVIEW - I’m an Italian Greyhound/Chihuahua and am very finicky when it comes to food, but I love the taste of the shredded chicken Pro Plan. Yum! I give it 4 pawsHALO’S REVIEW - I’m a Pomeranian and I’m not finicky at all. Give me any type of food and I’ll eat it, but my Mom, my HUMAN MOM, she’s a vet tech and she only feeds us Purina Pro Plan. She says it’s the best food. She’s had dogs before us and has always fed them this. Even our feline sister gets Pro Plan."
Veterinary Technician Recommended,"The very first ingredient is real chicken, not chicken by-product.  In fact, this formula of dog food has very little by-product in it.  My wife and I believe it's some of the best dog food around.  Our dogs are all happy, healthy, energetic, and have shiny coats, so we must be doing something right.The dogs love this food.  It has real pieces of chicken mixed in and they all have developed a unique way to eat it - they take a mouthful at a time and drop it on the floor.  They then separate the real chicken pieces from the rest and eat those first.  After the real chicken is gone, then they clean up the mess from the floor.  Gotta get the good stuff first, I guess.  It's sort of comical to watch.The Amazon Prime price on this dog food is on par with buying it at a brick-and-mortar pet store locally, so it's not a super-deal in that regard.  What it does have going for it, though, is the advantage of being delivered right to our door step.  Since my wife and I both work, not needing to take time out to go to shopping for this food makes this deal very compelling."
Good quality dog food delivered right to your door!,"I belong to a lot of dog breed specific FB groups (Golden Doodle) and they all say overwhelmingly that Purina Pro Plan is one of the best dog foods on the market today. Our dog loves it and as long as it continues to get rave reviews from the members of my groups, we'll be sticking with it."
Our Dog Loves It,"I have bought this dog several times . The chicken is not in it anymore just crumbs of chicken.  DISGUSTED!! WITH PRICE AS IT IS NOW QUALITY IS CRAP !!  people can't afford to have a pet . We are regular people and can't eat a steak it's to expensive. Do you really need this much !!! greed is a terrible thing. How sad . I won't be buying your dog food anymore. No thank you ! Don't suggest anyone else buy it,not worth the money at all."
Greedy people!!,"I have a pitbull mix and he has been picky with his dog food lately. I must admit, I would notice that he wouldn't eat his dog food, so I would give him table food, but it's gotten to the point where he holds out on his own food because he knows he'll get table food from me. Well, when I put some of this food in his food bowl, he instantly eat all of it. I've fed him 3 times so far, and each time he has eaten his own food while my son and I have been at the table eating our own food. Any other time he would've been right beside us begging for food, so we can definitely tell that he loves his doggy food!"
My dog loves it!,"I have 2 dogs that are very old, like me. I had been feeding them Purina Pro Plan dog food for a long time. I was reading about different dog foods and decided to make a healthier change. They did not like the change. At all!  Even though the new food is supposed to be a good food and healthy, If they won't eat it, it isn't the right one for us. Pro Plan has chicken pieces in it and I see those pieces that they have freeze dried. The dog food pieces are mostly round with the chicken pieces in it. I was really getting concerned that one of my girls was getting her ribs showing again. I also have probiotics for dogs and when this bag came, I started mixing a scoop of it in the food. I am supposed to wet the food to dissolve the powder. They are thrilled with both. They are licking the bowls when there is no food left. I think it is wonderful to try to feed your dogs healthy food but this is the one I will always buy from now on. It is a great product! Thanks Purina"
like me. I had been feeding them Purina Pro ...,"We buy this dog food for our dog Macy, she's a Lab German Shepherd mix she's a good sized girl. At first she didn't seem to like this food but after a few days she would eat this food and keep going until her bowl is clean. As far as the health benefits seem to go this food is definitely a good quality food, I do not care if it is grain-free or if it has grain in it a lot of grain-free foods are absolutely horrible for dogs. We've been feeding this food to our girl for about three months and she's now shedding less, more energetic and the probiotics in this blend of food really seem to help her with a few of her other issues. I can't recommend this food enough to people, especially if I hear them say they're feeding their dog a cheap low quality food."
Great healthy dog food,My dogs love this it helped them stay satisfied
Best dog food,"This product is recommended by the vet. This is the only dog food that my dog eats alone, with no other foods mixed in it. I also, bought it for my friends dog, who has the same problem. And he loves it and can eat just dry dog food alone. This dry dog food must be good, because they can  now eat it with nothing mixed in it. Thy love the freshness and flavor, which makes the quality ingredient the best."
Best dry dog food recommended by the vet,The price just goes up and up every month. Not worth the “repeat delivery” because you don’t get anything off. I will just go to the store and pay the same price.
Just ok,"This dog food has been life changing for our Boston Terrier. She’s 11, and we’ve been feeding her another “high end” brand of dog food for most of her life, until the recent no-grain dog food brands and link to heart disease news came out. Our vet recommended a list of 2-3 different foods to switch to. We tried this one first, thinking dog food is dog food, but WOW... She has morphed from a slower, senior-acting dog to a frisky and playful pup again! We feed all 3 of our dogs this food (Chihuahua, Boston and Catahoula) and couldn’t be happier. All the dogs love the little meat bits and never leave the kibble uneaten. They love it. We are so happy that this product changed our old dog’s life and made her happier and healthier. Thank you!!!"
Gave my old dog new life,Had to switch back to Rachael Ray for my lab didn’t like it a stopped eating and lost weight. Could count his ribs.My niece is a vet and recommends the Pro Plan but he didn’t care for it. My mutt loved it.
One dog loved it. The other hated it and lost weight,"First let me say that I have purchased this dog food for both of my dogs for the last 6 years. So I am a LOYAL purina pro plan customer and have only ever used this brand. We have always loved it…until the last couple of months. I’ve ALWAYS had their food stored in airtight containers, but recently I noticed there was bugs and worms in the food. Like not just a few bugs….I mean like infested with bugs and worms. So because I’m such a loyal customer that has loved purina, I thought there’s no way it could be the manufacturer’s fault. I figured I just needed to buy new vacuum sealed containers and that maybe my current containers had an issue. Let me also say that my house is incredibly clean and we don’t have any bugs anywhere else in the house. So I spent money on the top of the line food containers designed to keep out bugs. Then, I checked when I opened a new bag of purina, and I saw the bugs in the bag before I even poured it into my container. That’s when I knew the bug/worm infestation was not our container problem…but a Purina problem. I reported it to amazon and got a refund. Then, I still purchased more purina because I figured maybe it was just a bad batch. Well, now my last 2 orders also had bugs. One of them is outside the return window so I’m frustrated. Honestly my dogs love this food so if I get a response from Purina with how they are going to fix this, I am willing to remain a customer because I know mistakes happen. But if not, I’m going to have to transition my dogs to a different food unfortunately. Or maybe buy it directly from Petco and not amazon?"
buyer beware,Food is great delivery and handling is awful.  Been buying this for over two years and it is consistently late or doesn't show up at all and needs to be reordered.
DELIVERY IS LATE 95% OF THE TIME BECAUSE THE DRIVERS HATE THE HEAVY BAGS ORDER EARLY!!,Dr recommend this for my dog who’s been having trouble with diarrhea and urinating. So far so good
Dr recommend,"My vet recommended this brand several years ago and I stopped using it, one of my dogs have IBS this is the only food that doesn't upset his stomach, this is a great dog food. I have six dogs and they all like it."
Veterinary,Please use use instead of usps.  My female postal carrier leaves my 47lb bag at the post office.
Good food for your pet,"Mi perrito tiene 16 años y le gusta mucho esta comida, me imagino que tiene buen sabor, yo no lo he probado..!! Jejeje 😆"
Great dog food,"When we got our small Sheltie from a breeder (we happily adopted a pup who didn't meet their ""show dog"" standards - but she is perfect to us) they used this brand of food and we continued, first with the puppy formula and now for adults. Our vet approved us continuing and we alternate the chicken a beef with morning/dinner feedings. We like that it has the shredded pieces included to give some variety to traditional kibble. A big bag of each lasts for months/almost a year, so it really isn't too much to spend. Tried the Amazon delivery this time rather than lugging it home from PetCo. I felt for our post woman who had to lug it out of her mail truck, because it is heavy at 35 pounds. At least she pulled up in our driveway to get it out. It sure was convenient for me, and the price the same or slightly less as going to PetCo. I'd give it 5 stars if my Sheltie could talk and give more feedback."
A mi perro le gusta,Dog foid
Sheltie eats it up,"My dog (coonhound) just turned 3 and every brand I have tried of dog food, she let's sit for hours. I always thought she was a weird dog since she wouldn't scarf down her food or she would walk away after I poured food in her dish. someone told me about this kind so we tried it. She loves it! I have never seen her this excited over food before. She knew what was in the box as soon as I brought it in. She started wagging her tail very excited for dinner."
Dog food,"To my husband and I has come our newly adopted Australian Cattle Dog, Ralph, he is 5 years old and he's wonderful!  He's been through the Missouri Puppies for Parole program, offered to prisoners in the State of Missouri.  He LOVES PURINA PRO PLAN DRY FOOD, SAVOR.  His foster mother said "" get Purina Pro Plan for him"".  He is house trained, comes, sits, stays and walks like a champion with me, I am 70 years old.  I jumped into Amazon and found Purina Pro Wet and Dry food for him AND it's PRIME.  The boxes arrived just as I expected. He eats Chicken and Rice.  He's about 44 pounds and at the fosters instruction I give him 1 1/4 cup dry and about 2 big tbls. Wet - 2 X a day.  I mix the wet with a about 1/4 cup very warm water, to make a gravy and then add 1 1/4 cup dry, then mix again.  RALPHY LOVES PURINA!!!!  And I don't have to worry about him being poisoned with foreign foods.  Our last Cattle Dog lived 17 years, with good care and Purina.  WE LOVE PURINA PRO PLAN."
My dog loves it!,I gave my dog his first bowl and he loved it! He was almost dancing while he ate! I got him more and he ate a few bites and was full. He went and laid by the bag before I picked it up and poured it in the food storage container. I’ve never seen a dog so happy to get off of a high dollar puppy food and go to adult food. This stuff is amazing!
WE GET A GOLD STAR AND SO DOES PURINA!,I have switched my dog to this type of dog food this past year and she seems to like it more and has been doing well stomach wise BUT the last two times I have ordered this from Amazon I have had a problem with the packaging. Please check your bag well. I have ordered numerous times from them and haven't had an issue till the end of November and now in middle of december. First bag had hole (box was fine so it was placed in box with a hole) and I went to return and they replaced it and said not to return which was great and the bag I got was fine. This time the bag wasn't vacuumed sealed and when you look from the top it has a hole! I called Amazon this time and of course customer service is always good and is refunding me (gave me option of getting replaced again but this is the 2nd time so I will go to the store from now on). I called to see if they could make sure this is fixed but I am also posting this to make sure others can see this is really inspect your dog food. Who knows what could get in the bag if theres a hole. Bugs or it could be stale.The dog food itself is good so far. Has little bits of dried meat in it which my dog loves and her sensitive stomach has been good with it.I love Amazon and I'm sure its not every bag of dog food and it could be purinas packaging because this time it was the sealing of the bag but just be careful.
Must Taste Great!,"We have feed our 11 yo Aussie iVet for years.He started to refuse to eat. And we've been worried.Finally, I contacted his breeder, and she recommended ProPlan.He literally TORE INTO THE BAG.  He wolfed it down. It was such a relief.She said ""Oh wait for his coat to come in - it's going to really improve and you'll notice a big difference.""Purina is a company you can trust.  Unlike ""Blue Buffalo"" which my friend a vet and also our OWN vet said to avoid like, crazy.Thank goodness, we've been worried so much.Thanks Purina."
Hole in one bag and not sealed right in another,and my dog could not be healthier.  All the issues she was having with diarrhea and upset stomach on Blue Buffalo have gone away.  Sensitivity to certain snacks and treats has gone away.  She was never excited about eating Blue Buffalo but now she loves meal times.  I so regret wasting money on such an expensive food before.  And I stock with it because people claimed it was a good food.I did a lot of research on Purina and other dog foods.  I got advice from two vets locally.  And I am very happy I made this choice and I believe my puppy is too.
Finally. He loves it.,My spaniel seems to prefer the Purina beef or lamb options.
I have now been using this dog for for over a month,"The product was fine .The price not only went up, but the delivery was late . This ended up costing me more money because my dogs ran out of food .I had to go to a store and purchase food until the delivery day. I may end up canceling this automatic purchase because it's going to cost more than buying it locally. I'm worried that the late delivery might happen again ."
Not his favorite but acceptable,Gave my dogs diarrhea
Price increase and late delivery  = hungry dogs .,"Not top of the line food by any means, but also not the bottom of the line either.  It is a good middle ground food and my dogs seem to do well on it.  I have been feeding it for over a year now.  I may switch it up soon to another flavor, but will stick with Purina Pro Plan as I know they do ALL the testing and follow all the guidelines for good quality food."
Gas,"Started my Aussiepoo & my Pyrenees puppy out on the Pro Plan, based on conversations with trainers & a number of veterinarians. They like it, they have had nothing else and they strive on it. What else can be said? Regular check up, Heartgard, Bravecto, etc. They are part of the family. ...both are 2 years old. One Farm Dog & One Lap Dog"
Decent food,"Always a vast amount of dried chicken in it, and my dogs stand there and wait for me to cut open the fresh bag every time! Very satisfied, has eliminated my dogs stomach issues, and they love it. Now they refuse to eat any other food. Haha!"
Started my Aussiepoo & my Pyrineese puppy out on the Pro Plan.,"We needed a new and one that had good ingredients. The vet suggested Purina pro or royal Canine and we went with this since it was cheaper. It had chunks of dried chicken in it which my pup loves. After a full bag of this I’ve seen her energy, coat and body composition change drastically for the better. Although it’s more expensive it is actually good for your pups and worth it! Buy the bigger bags on sale and put it on auto ship which also gives you a discount"
My dogs love this,"Our dogs love this Purina product, flavor and freshness are qualities not found on other products.We recommend this."
My dog lives for this,"My dog is a lazy little apartment dweller, and always on the lookout for a snack, so keeping her at a healthy weight is a challenge - there's not much leeway weight-wise when you are a 15 pound dog. She didn't like most canned or dry food, whether from the store or the vet, so she begged all the time. Our vet recommended this food, and even said we should order it at Amazon because it is hard to find on the store shelves here.That vet surely knows his stuff. My dog tore into the first bowl of this food like it was her first meal in days. Over the last three vet visits, her weight has stayed exactly the same. The food is easy to digest, so there is a lot less waste to pick up. The main ingredient is chicken, which is probably a lot better for a carnivore than a corn-based food. She's really cut down on the begging, too. I guess because she is getting better nutrition, she's probably not as hungry all the time. We didn't have to introduce the food gradually, either. Just switched to the new food, no stomach upset or any other trouble.Try it - your dog will thank you! Well, actually, the dog will probably just eat, but you'll know he'd thank you if he could!"
Flavor is foremost!,Thank you.
"Recommended by our vet, and wow, was he right!","I switched my senior dog to this brand a few months ago. Not only does he eat more regularly, and immediately, he is more energetic and has a shinier coat. Very pleased customer!"
My dog really likes to eat it.,Doggo is sick of kibble but this one he eats with pleasure. Will keep purchasing
Senior dog love it!,"vet recommended this food for my dog due to her past diet and heart issues. she immediately started eating this, when she’s not a good-oriented dog. never seen her try food and continue to eat it as soon as it’s down! she loves this stuff."
Dog loves it,"My dog was eating Pure balance from Walmart, and he was having a lot of allergies during the day. The doctor recommended this brand as his fur was really suffering with his allergies. He is doing pretty good with this brand since then. This was the third time I got his food from Amazon, and the only time I had issues with it was the second time, when I could not find any of the shreds inside of the food. This one was pretty much good so we are happy with this purchase."
My Dog Loves This!,"We switched to this brand from Blue Buffalo on a recommendation from our vet and others. Before, our dog was so sluggish and had no energy. He would let his food sit and only take small nibbles of the food. Now, as soon as he hears me scooping this food into his bowl he comes running and stands there and gobbles the entire bowl down and looks for me when he's done! He also is much more energetic! Within a month of eating the new food, his coat has gotten so much more soft and shiny. Definitely will be purchasing another bag!"
Good food,"The measure of a good seller is customer service response when there is an issue. The 5 stars are for this supplier (as not been consuming food long enough to rate that yet) as other comments cover well the attributes of the Pro Plan food itself.There was an issue with order fulfillment. The supplier's response was not only swift but supportive as well. Also when researching prior to 1st purchase, seeing supplier's response to issues discussed in comments I thought was very cool.The Bright Mind line is admittedly a major hardship for me as a disabled person to afford, however this supplier was so awesome and reception to the food so far has been positive I plan to switch my cats to the Pro Plan Focus line as well and purchase thru this supplier if at all possible. My furchildren may eat better than I do -- and they are totally worth it. Completing transactions with this seller is as well.Hope this was helpful in making a decision."
Our dog loves it!,"I have a cocker spaniel and at mixed breed that both enjoy this food greatly.  My mixed breed is a VERY picky eater.  She would only eat her kibble if it had some ""extra"" in it - gravy, pan drippings, chopped up real meat, etc.  Plain kibble and she would walk away and only eat when she was ""desperate"".  We tried 4 or 5 different ""fancy"" brands one of those had freeze dried meat bits in it. She loved that one ( was super expensive!).  So my wife found this and we've been golden ever since!We've caught our cat picking out the chicken bits in it when the dog wasn't looking as well."
Excellent Supplier!,"My dogs love the all Pro Plan flavors, but this is their favorite. My fellas are persnickety in their eating habits, but I have no problem getting them to eat Pro Plan. It's easy on my old guy's stomach, the younger one sucks it down like his belly is rubbing a hole in his backbone, and it provides value with respect to the amount of protein per cup.I care about how much yard I need to clean up weekly, Pro Plan does not promote pooping like some foods do. The feeding is economical (2.5-3 cups for a 50 lb dog) and I have less to clean up in the yard after. My niece's dogs like it too, when I'm dog-sitting. I purchase the 35-pound package, and it lasts 5-6 weeks. The subscription service is offered so that I get it automatically in time for one bag to run out just as I get the new one."
Both my dogs and even my cat enjoy this food!,                    The media could not be loaded.
Perfect dog food for my guys in an economical package. Subscription shipping meets my needs nicely!,                
He Loves It!, I highly recommend this dog food. The video speaks for itself. The freshness and flavor is apparently off the chain by the reaction of our Debo and his piggy oinks while devouring the very 1st bowl I got him. He doesn't ever do that either.
Donated to local shelter.,Must be good stuff since Animal  shelter recommended.  Not sure of the taste since I don’t eat dog food.  Tried a dog biscuit about 60 years ago.  Didn’t care for it.  Appears to have lots of protein and was advertised by Westminster Kennel Club.
More than just your regular boring bites -,"I just love eating dog food, it's quick on the go and really convenient. Kidding, kidding. My friend recommended this food after I adopted my dog just a month or so ago (she's going on 8 months now). Her dog has been eating it for awhile and well my dog loves it too. It's nice to see other chunks besides just the boring ""dog food"" bites -- the freeze dried yumms that you usually pay extra for at the pet store. This is very affordable and seems to be a high quality food that my dog absolutely loves. I wouldn't say she's a picky eater  by any means so I can say it's a win for all dogs; however, something tells me the extra bits likely help. I plan on buying this for many years to come (hopefully it stays around that long)."
LATEST BATCH IS MAKING MY DOGS SICK!!!,"After years of buying this product for our dogs, which was recommended by several vets, our dogs are now getting sick with vomit and diarrhea, waking us up several times at night to have to make a run for it. We thought they may be eating something outside, but we've watched them for a couple of months to make sure they weren't, during which we took them off of the food for weeks at a time, feeding them cooked chicken and rice, instead. They were doing great while on that diet, but as soon as we put them back on the Purina Pro Plan, the fun started all over again, almost immediately. After several times testing this, because we couldn't understand how this could happen, after all of our dogs have been eating this for years, we are taking them off of this food. It's unfortunate because we subscribed to it to save and stay on track, so I have another big bag of it, but it's worth the loss to not have our boys sick. I've read numerous other stories online about similar issues with this food, so we're done.I'm going to reach out to the customer service to see if they're willing to take the unopened bag we currently have back, or not."
"Purina Pro Plan with Probiotics Shredded Blend High Protein, Adult Dry Dog Food Chicken & Rice",My dogs love this food!
Good dog food and value,"A couple of our dogs are sensitive to just about every ingredient in most dog foods. So we've tried a lot of brands and flavors. So far this one seems like it has been the easiest on our dogs' stomachs and they really like it. And it is considerably cheaper than most brands we've been through. That's a good thing, since 3 of them are over 65 pounds. My only negative would be that the food ships in an enormous box. They could easily shop it in a box half the size."
Saves you from carrying out to your car,"Been feeding this to my Molly since she went off of puppy food. This price is about the same as Petsmart but I don’t have to drive to the store load, pay and carry out to my car. Convenience and cost what’s not too like"
beef and lamb ProPlan Savor for my Great Dane and Great Dane mix,"I purchase the chicken, beef and lamb ProPlan Savor for my Great Dane and Great Dane mix, they both look forward to me filling their bowls with it every day and both maintain a healthy weight.  Their vet feeds it to their dogs as well so I feel confident this is as good a choice as you can make for someone on a budget that wants to feed their dogs decent food-- that being said, I wish it came in bigger than 35lbs, occasionally if I buy it at the store I can get a bag with an ""extra 10%"" and it lasts a little while longer, but for over $1 a pound I wish there was more in the bag, especially having two dogs that eat as much as mine do, I end up purchasing a new bag every two weeks to keep up with their meals."
"All great, except delivery.  You have to pick it up at the Post Office.  Not again for us..","All great, except delivery.  You have to pick it up at the Post Office.  Not again for us.."
Quality nutrition for my picky eater,"Bought this dog food for my Great Dane, she's a very picky eater at times, wouldn't eat her regular dog food she has been on for last 2 years, I put some of this dog food in her bowl and she loved it and cleaned the whole bowl, I was amazed! She has been eating this regularly for about a month now with no problems, I mix a little warm water in it to make a gravy and she loves it. Glad I took a chance and tried it!"
Golden retriever loved it.,My dog loved it.  There was no stomach issues. The product seemed as fresh as when I purchase this in the b&m stores. Was delivered quickly.
The kibble is HUGE!!!,"I fed my beagle the puppy version of this for a bit until she was almost an adult. I figured I could use this for her and my chihuahua.  But this kibble is so big! Even for a beagle, it is huge. I don't know if it is supposed to be this big because I notice the pics of this food it looks much smaller. I wonder if I got a faulty bag? My dogs don't like it as much either."
Great,"Fast delivery, good quality!"
Excellent Price for Huge Bag,"I purchased a 35.5 pound bag for my two 15lb dogs. It took them three months to go through it and at the end, they were bored of the flavor. The price for the size though can’t be beat! If it didn’t take so long for them to go through it and if the bags weren’t so huge, I would buy two flavor and switch every month to month and a half."
Product never received,Never received product
Tasty and wholesome,"I mixed Pro Plan with my dogs more costly Hill’s Science Diet they had become a bit tired of. I selected Pro Plan because I used it years before when it was recommended by my (very expensive) veterinarian - it was his favorite, regardless of cost. The addition of the Pro Plan revived the dog’s interest!"
"My dog is a finicky eater, but she'd dug in and acted starve.",Product delivers on it taste my dog loves chicken!
Superior Dog Food,"This was recommended by vet as a superior dog food. My cats, who are so picky that they will not eat most expensive cat food, will try to eat this pro food. It cost more, my Golden Retriever is worth it. I also buy Purina Pro Cat Food. So pleased with both products. You get what you pay for."
All my animals flock to this food...even the ones not allowed to,"First i think its funny they ask about the taste.  LETS BE CLEAR I DIDNT TASTE IT!  But my dog likes it.  And it must be extra tasty because the cats try and eat it too. And usually they avoid her food.  We transitioned to this food (as of all the positive things i’ve seen), with no problems.  She tolerated well.  No issues.  I should also mention my pup is extremely picky with food.  And she will eat this!  Will continue to buy"
Not worth it at all.,Amazon delivers this 35lb. bag to a post office where I have to lug it out to my car and back up to my house.  Absolutely terrible value in my view.
My dog thinks the soft pieces are treats,My dog seems happy and content
I think Amazon Plus is losing money on me-BUT I LOVE IT. My only negative is the bags that ...,"It is so so handy for me to receive these dog food packages once a month using the Subscribe And Save program.  Not only is the price substantially less than at either of the stores near me, but to have directly delivered to my  storage building is such a plus!  Not only do I not have to wrestle all four or five of the bags (have 6 dogs about 100 pounds each), but it also saves me the 20 mile trip to town as I am in a rural area.  I think Amazon Prime is losing money on me-BUT I LOVE IT.  My only negative is the bags that keep getting smaller--I do remember 50 pound bags, but now we are less than 40...but all the manufacturers are doing that!"
"Good food, good price, convenient Subscribe & Save delivery","This has been one of my favorite finds on Amazon. The large bag of food sells for the same price as my local PetSmart or PetCo with the added perks of free delivery and automatic shipments through Subscribe & Save. My two dogs, a boxer mix and a husky mix, have been eating it for over two years and are mostly happy with this food. The boxer is completely happy, but the husky is a picky eater. I used to buy expensive grain free food and she wouldn't touch it at all. She's still picky about this one but she seems to prefer it over the others we've tried. Most of the cheaper foods are made mostly out of corn or grain, while this lists chicken as the first ingredient so I feel ok about feeding it to them."
Dogs seem to like it,"So good things are that the dogs like it and the ingredients seem to be on the good side so there is that, price is not the greatest but I am ordering from Amazon and it is getting delivered to my apartment so I expect it to be a little more expensive."
Veterinarian (my daughter) approved!,My veterinarian daughter recommended I get this food when I adopted my Rottweiler & I'm glad I did. I have been purchasing it through Prime for 1½ years. The price has gone way up but what hasn't?Great dog food.....
Play Sand - Brown,This item is as represented. I can recommend.
Very powdery,"Definitely not a favorite. It is very messy due to having an excessive amount of crushed powdered food mixed in and my dog doesn't care for the taste, she spits it out all over the floor."
Happy dogs!,We’ve purchased this food in the past and recently came back to it. The dogs seem to live it. I like the size of the kibble and shredded meat. Most importantly the dog is really happy with the change. Time will tell as to the health benefits.
Good,"My dog has been on this for quite a while.  She likes the taste, it provides a lot of energy, and it’s very good for her digestion.  What more can you ask from a dog food?"
Picky dog approved.,"Our 2 year old dog is very picky and she has been through many types of food- some that cost even more than this, but she gets sick of each food without weeks.I tried wet food, which was easier since my older dog has wet food, but she wouldn't eat even that after a few weeks.... then I tried this dry food and so far so good, she hasn't gotten tired of it yet!I would be careful what size you get though.  I tried to get a big bag and saved money and it took her months to eat... and I think it was getting stale (not sure) but now I only buy the small size since she takes forever to eat it."
My animals love it!,"We try to feed our dogs with good quality food. The other brands we were using met with indifference or disgust. We recently had to switch brands as the senior dog got an ulcer and after a few bad changes this is the brand they absolutely love. No more wandering away from a full bowl. When it's chow time they dash to the dishes and devour every delicious morsel! If the dogs aren't careful, even the cat will take a few pieces and greedily consume it.We've noticed no I'll effects from this chow that we've seen from other all natural foods we were trying to get them on. No dry skin, no itching or allergic reactions. Just eager appetites and satisfied stomach's."
Great product - 14 y/o dog has NO issues with this food,"My 14 year old mixed breed loves the Pro Plan products,  He was having digestion problems with many other brands --- been using this brand for over a year now -  no more throwing up, no more loose bowls and he eats it quickly.  Feed him twice a day - no range feeding here.  He is 22 - 25 pounds and he gets about 3/4 cup (or less) twice a day.  Do not substitute with other products since he has been using it.  .With in a minute of putting the food in his bowl - he is eating with gusto!It also seems to have regulated his bowels - needing to go out with an hour of eating and no more loose/wet bowels  since he has been on it."
Delvery a deal breaker,"The dog food is fine, however I will not be ordering from Amazon because I had to go to post office to get it.  if I had known that I could have just made the drive to PetSmart as it is right in the same location"
My rescue loves it!,"I rescued a dog last weekend and I wanted something middle of the range price but not low quality. To my surprise, she gobbled this up the first day I had her (and every day since) and did not have any runny poops. Typically changing a dog's food causes some less than ideal poops, and she wasn't on this food before. I really think this food is great."
Recommend by vet. He feeds to his dogs,"Both my dogs love this, especially the tender bits. The minpin will pick them out 1st. The bully pit just eats all of it at once. They don't usually share bowls unless minpin finishes her tender ones & sneaks in the other bowl."
Yes BUY IT!,"I break it down to buy it or not.  And I TOTALLY expect a lot from products.  I am a consumer who wants the most for her money....Good stuff! I have had 2 dogs on this food.  One dog I was fostering got adopted, about a month later the new ""parents"" texted me to get the name of this food AGAIN...I had left them with a bag and wrote down the name.  They chose to buy a more expensive brand and the dog wasn't eating.  Look at the ingredience, compare it...or just be happy  I already did it for you and listen to my review,  and know that the ingredients are great! Your dog's digestive tract will be fine..nice on the coat too.  Plus A+ for cost and delivery is easy. Comes in a really strong bag<~~~important."
A little pricey,"4 stars for flavor- I haven’t tried it, but the doodle has been eating this for almost 10 years and never complained😋"
Great quality ingredients,"A dog food we have been proud to feed our dogs for quite some time. The variety of formulas made it possible to find a flavor they wouldn't tire of, and the ingredients are some we feel good about. Our fur babies deserve it!"
My dogs love it!,"This has been hard to find in the store, most pet stores have gone out of business due to COVID. Both my dogs love this food. I have to cut their portions in half and fake them out to make them think they’re getting seconds. Both dogs are seniors and they gobble it right up!"
Probiotic works for Dogs,"Dog Food is Great, GOOD LEWELLEN, THIS SELLER IS NOT. BUY FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.I have a Rottie, I have alway fed her the Purina Pro Plan, but i fed her the Sport.  She has trouble getting constipated.  i changed to this Pro Biotic and she has not had any problems since.  so glad i switched."
DO NOT BUY,"I don't write reviews, but this deserves it.  Made my dogs deathly sick.  I've only gotten Pro Plan from our local store but decided to purchase on Amazon.  I've never had a problem with my dogs getting sick until I opened this bag, and they were all puking nonstop.  I almost took them to the vet. I've been a dog owner for the last 30 yrs and have never seen anything like it.  I'm out $65 as it is non-refundable product. I wanted to ship it right back.  DO NOT BUY!!!!"
High quality food that my dogs love,"My dogs love this food!  I was actually given this in the canned version by my veterinary internist, prior to this I would never have fed my dogs Purina-I thought all Purina was cheap grocery store food.  But this food is wonderful quality, the dogs absolutely love it and their coats are softer & shinier since changing to this food, from grain free over two years ago."
Go to Dog Food,"My dog always loves this product. After only buying her Walmart Brand dog food she started eating less, her fur started losing color and her nails began to develop shells. Her Vet told us it was time to switch her to a food that had more nutrients and was a healthier fit for her. She is a 70 lb German Shepard and I couldn’t be happier with the results."
Ingredients that are good for your dog.,"Ingredients are good for our dogs, I cannot say if the flavor is good because I haven't eaten it but they have. As for the price , it is not a bad price for something that has good ingredients."
What a great driver!,The Prime driver physically brought this huge bag up on my deck! I was so appreciative because I have difficulty lifting it. I wanted to thank him personally. Great employee. 🌺
Nutritious for my dogs,My dogs like this food and seem to digest it well. No allergies have been identified and the ages of my dogs are from 1-3.
i had to switch brands,"used this years but this year its not agreeing with her. swiched away from purina to a sensitive stomach type, doing better."
Dog loves it!,"He's fighting cancer, but he eats this!"
Great delivery and in timely fashion,I love the time the product came in. Never had a problem with freshness or the dog food.
Great product,It makes me dogs hair very silky and shiny!! My dog isnt crazy about the taste but I purina pro plan wet food to eat and he loves it.
Great for senior dog,My lab is 13 years old and on pain meds which causes her stomach problem. Tried several food (name brand and organic to grain free) to offset her stomach being upset and this ended up helping.
Expired dog food,The best dog food but it was expired and it’s cheaper at feed stores
Dogs love it & they’re all happy & healthy. Can’t complain one bit.,"Despite the fact that I get hassled by some of my well-meaning fellow dog people about using this food, my dogs love it and they have thrived on it for years. I confess I fell for the trend of grain-free, cage-free, gluten-free, organic, limited ingredient, etc foods. My dogs seemed ready to organize a hunger strike. So I switched back permanently &  everyone gets the proplan shredded blend that best suits their dietary needs (puppy, senior, adult, or small breed). And they’re all healthy with great coats, nice teeth, high (so high!) energy. And it’s moderately priced so I don’t have to starve myself to feed my dogs (but I totally would if I had to!)."
Like the price can’t go wrong,My dogs love the flavor of the chicken that dried .and I like because it has proboits for there stomach .the price is good for 18 pounds bag .recommend  to have delivered.
My Dog loves the crunchy parts,"Canned food is rediculously high priced imo. I have lost so much money buying dry food that my dog refuses to eat. She loves the crunchy bits of this. I thought she would like the soft bits but she didn't even lick one of those. I'm ok with that, I'll leave those out for the wild critters. I'm thrilled that after a year I finally found a dry food my Doodle likes!"
My dog loves it.,The ingredients are essential to my dogs health.
Try Purina ProPlan if your dog is a picky eater. It's Amazing,"Since I rescued our dog Sheba , a shepherd mix, from the Arkansas Paws in Prison program I have had a horrible time trying to find something that Sheba would eat besides table food.  It's almost been a year and tried many dog foods but never the Purina Pro Plan blend til now.  I just recieved a few minutes ago opened it and filled Sheba's bowl.  OMG she devoured it like she was starving to death and I had just fed her a can of Alpo earlier this morning which she reluctantly ate but this was about the only thing I could get her to eat in the way of dog food, that is, until the ProPlan.  It's amazing and I can hardly believe it.  Sold Sold Sold"
Dog isn’t eating it all,Hi I’m just trying to get in contact with someone.I noticed towards the middle of the bag some pieces were like crumbles. I really started noticing it when my dog was only eating those pieces. There’s not many of those and she is now refusing to eat the triangle pieces and having to throw the rest out.She’s been getting sick lately as well.I’m hoping to get some answers.I will take down I just was trying to get ahold of someone so please reply
Great food,This dog food was recommended for my 10 year old pit bull. Ever since we started using this food my dog hasn’t had any stomach issues.
Purina pro plan probiotics,"I am a veterinary technician and I LOVE THIS FOOD! My dogs love it and one is super picky. I love the pre and probiotics. Reduces stomach gurgles, GAS, and over all reduce booting in his abdomen."
DELIVERY,"I love this dog food , BUT they leave it at my mailbox rather than bringing to the house...it's a 47# bag.  I would appreciate it being put on my front porch"
Let Prime Deliver To Your Door!,"I have a 4 year old pudelpointer and a 6 year old cockapoo and we use Prime to deliver this huge bag of food to our door each month. First, the price is directly competitive with a box store and, second, I don't have to carry the heavy awkward back a half mile across a parking lot and back home. The food itself is great quality, we have never had any issues and the dogs both love it. My pudelpointer is an active hunter and he will scarf this down and keep right on running. We will stick with this as long as Purina keeps making it!"
Something changed. Was great,Why did the color of the food get darker? Also the shredded chicken pieces got smaller and less soft. My dog used to dig those out first as soon as i filled the bowl. Now she barely goes after a few pieces
Bad Batch,"I'd been feeding this to my dog for over a year and he enjoyed it until last March 2022. When I open this latest bag, I noticed that some of the chicken chicken looked a smaller, so I just figured the processing was just cutting them smaller similar to what we are seeing in all consumer products now (increased price with smaller portions). My dog threw up 4 times within 5 minutes of completing his breakfast.  I assumed he just ate too fast.  However he three up the same at dinner.  I tried a couple things including cutting portion size,  slowing down eatting process, removing chicken chunks, etc,.  No improvement.  Looked at AMAZON reviews to see if anyone else had experienced this besides me.  Wow.  Had to go to the Pet store to buy off the shelf."
Seems like good dog food,Dog food is loved by my boys shipping is highly disliked my me 😁  PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS SHIPPED USPS AND EVERY TIME THEY CLAIM ATTEMPTED DELIVERY AND SAY I HAVE TO PICK IT UP FROM USPS.. MY OFFICE FACES THE DOOR..  THEY NEVER ATTEMPT DELIVERY! I have no idea how fresh or what the flavor is but my dogs like it.  The scheduled delivery timing just doesn't work for us.
My dog's favorite!,"Don't know what they put in this stuff but this is my dog's favorite food. We have been rotating bags every time she finishes them, one after the other, for two years. This is the only food she goes head down into her bowl for, and licks the bowl when it's empty. Why this is significant: my dog is the least food-motivated dog I've ever known. She has no interest in food. It is not unusual for her to go 24-36 hours without eating. This food changed that pattern! She LOVES it!"
Dogs and the Cat Love it!,"I have a Boston pit, golden doodle and a cat who all love this dog food!  My cat is 16 years old and refuses to eat cat food after stealing Purina Pro Plan from the dogs!"
Vet Recommended and dog approved!,My boxador was pretty picky when it came down to trying different types of dog food. We tried several types with the same results. Any unhappy dog. I asked my sister who is a veterinarian and she highly recommended this brand food. The price is a little higher however think about the food you eat. Would you want to eat a cheap hamburger or would you pay slightly more for a better steak? The food doesn't have a terrible smell or look. My dog absolutely loves it.  There is no need to pay the big bucks for the brands you always see advertised. They are well known only because they put money out to advertise.  With Purina pro plan you will get exactly what you pay for..Quality!
All dogs that come to my house live it,My dogs love it
It's great healthy food!,"It's the best dog food out there!! I've raised 4 dogs on this food with no skin issues, no potty issues, no coat issues and no weight issues. I highly recommend this product."
My Dogs Love It,"One of my dogs was a very picky eater who had been on a prescription diet for most of his life. When he was cleared for regular food at last, I went through many varieties, hoping to find one he would actually eat, including some very expensive specialty foods. After a day or two he would turn up his nose at them, until I found ProPlan, which he clearly loved, as did my two hounds (although with basset hounds, it is unusual to find any food they don't enjoy!)I was very happy to find I could buy it for monthly delivery, rather than having to schlepp to the store every couple of weeks for a new bag! My vet, who always asks what I am feeding my pets, told me she approved of ProPlan, as well, which made me feel good about feeding it."
Would buy again,Would buy again!
Good quality,My fur babies have done very well with this food.Highly recommend!
... the Iams I had been using and my dogs loved it. I have a giant dog and a ...,I got this when Amazon was out of the Iams I had been using and my dogs loved it.  I have a giant dog and a petite dog and both really seem to like the food.  I have seen no evidence of waste as you would see using a cheap food with a giant dog.  I highly recommend it.Absolutely no evidence of any bug infestations as I have read in some reviews.Update.  After another price increase I have gone back to Iams.  My dogs never had any problems with the Pro Plan but it now costs about $15 more than Iams and my dogs eat the Iams just fine.
"Yummy for Four Tummies, one ""sensitive""","Taste of Wild or Purina ProPlan Chicken are Both are equally loved by 2 female chihuahuas, male dachshund, and the chi-weenie baby of the younger chi and dachshund.  I find a slight pref for this one among all 4.  We even get a bit if growling between the 2 chi females when dinner is served. My male has a sensitive stomach which has 3 pancreatic flare ups and a few grand in overnight vet stays and tolerates this and tow wonderfully.  I'm recording our 3rd 35lb bag so everyone loves it.  Funny aside..there are some larger morsels that must taste better than the others b/c the 2 female chi eat around the bowl and pick these out first."
We had been shopping around for a dog food that would be good for them and that they liked,"We bought this dog food for our two medium sized dogs. We had been shopping around for a dog food that would be good for them and that they liked. We also needed a big enough bag that it would last them. We bought the biggest bag that they have, and we also made it a subscription so that it comes every month! We feed them twice a day, and the bag lasts the month. We have never had any issues with the food or delivery! Our boys seem to like it a lot. They will be outside, and they'll hear us fill their bowl and be waiting by the door. They gobble it down quick, that's for sure!"
My dog loves Purina Pro Plan,Subscribing to have Purina Pro Plan delivered each month works out great. You get a slight discount and it’s right at my door. The product is good and my dog loves it.
Quality product,"I have 2 fairly large dogs and have this product delivered on a subscription.  This is the first time that when my husband opened the box and lifted out the bag, dog food fell out because there was a hole on the bottom of the bag.  My husband had to clean up the floor from the mess.  I was quite surprised since this has never happened before ."
Great!,My dog loves it!
My dog approves.,My labradoodle is picky eater but seems to like this food pretty well.  It has hard kibble and also morsels of dried chicken bits.  His vet recommended this brand and he eats it.  Win-win.
I no longer have a dog.,I cancelled the subscription to the food because I no longer have a dog.  The food was fine.
Good dog food.,My dogs coat is fantastic.  Veterinarian recommends.  Dog always eats and is in good health.
Great product,Read the ingredients then you automatically know it is good for your pets
Great dog food!,"My vet recommended this after trying every healthy and special dog food out there. Our dog kept has loose stools and other issues, and about 2 weeks on this food, his stools were already better. He’s been on this food for about 2 years now and he loves it!"
Made dogs sick!!!,I am not sure what’s going on but the color of this food this time around has changed and it definitely has less chicken. Not sure if I got a bad batch but 2 out of my 3 dogs are sick from eating this food for just one week!!!!
Good food for dogs,Giving the flavor a high mark was really just a guess overall. My dogs of different sizes are very happy with the flavor it seems like. It was an easy transition from their previous food and I haven’t seen any stomach issues.
Long-time customer! Very pleased!,"We have been feeding this food to our dogs for about 10 years. It was recommended by our vet when we found out our lab couldn't tolerate beef.  All of our dogs seem to enjoy this food. We have several different breeds of dogs, including a husky and a terrier mix, so it's versatile between the different breeds and sizes.  It has two textures. One is the traditional harder pellets and the other is a more natural shaped (slightly softer) piece.  Our cat would eat this if we let him!"
Happy Puppy!,"My dog is food-crazy and she loves this product. It keeps her tummy happy, which makes me happy too. No gas, no bloating, she's even lost some weight and is a healthy, lean, happy puppy. She's coming up on 3 years old and I will continue to purchase this dog food! I like that the pieces look like real food, and not just kibbles. Stays fresh and is always packaged well."
DON'T BUY,This was an Amazon's Choice product and it made my puppy terribly sick. We were about to bring her to the vet which would have cost a fortune in tests to figure out what was wrong. She was having to get up every hour in the night with diarrhea and was vomiting too.
My dog loves this food,"My dog has been eating only this food for the entire time we've had her, which is almost three years. She loves it, never has a problem eating it, and she is very healthy. It is also a good value."
Greyhounds like it.,"We have picky greyhounds so we are constantly searching for a food they will eat.  They love this food.  It was recommended by someone in an online greyhound group, so we tried it.  We have 3 greyhounds and they cleaned their bowls the first night.  They don’t always eat it at breakfast time but they have been consistently eating it for dinner.  The food is larger kibble and more than one shape."
A Great Dane. Bichon and Malti-Poodle love this food.,"My 3 dogs love this food.  I used to buy Purina One, Lamb with Rice from the grocery store.  My Great Dane did well on in, but my Bichon would only eat the dark morsels, leaving the light ones all over the floor. When I switched to the Chicken Pro Plan Food, I figured there might be some problems with the change.  To my surprise, the only difference is that my Bichon eats both the light and dark pieces, and I don't have to sweep the floor every day.I free-feed this food to a 10-year=old Great Dane, a 10-year=old  Bichon Frieze and a 2-year-old small Malti-Poodle. They are all indoor dogs, get no table food, and all have great teeth and breath as a result.."
Tasty Food My Dog Loves and Her Itching Has Decreased Significantly,"My dog loves this food. She’s been eating it for several months now. She is very happy with the combination of soft and crunchy textures. Of note, her itching has diminished drastically since on this food even though it’s not grain free. I don’t think it’s a coincidence. She’s has had a major itching problem for several years due to seasonal allergies (although she is affected year round as we live in the south) that has required prescription medication and she barely scratches now. Is it the new food? I’m not 100% sure but I will definitely keep feeding her this."
My Aussie loves this combo of crunchy and softer pieces together!,"I have a 4 year old, fussy mini Aussie, and she really loves this food. The combination of the crunchies with the shredded softer chicken pieces are just perfect for her. She now eats her whole meal at once, instead of picking all day, and not enjoying her food/flavor."
On time good product,On time and good product. Didn’t eat it myself but dogs appear to enjoy it.
It’s good for my Lab.,"It seems to have quite a bit of fine bits in there, otherwise my dog really loved it!"
Good dog food and value,"A couple of our dogs are sensitive to just about every ingredient in most dog foods.  So we've tried a lot of brands and flavors.  So far this one seems like it has been the easiest on our dogs' stomachs and they really like it.  And it is considerably cheaper than most brands we've been through.  That's a good thing, since 3 of them are over 65 pounds.  My only negative would be that the food ships in an enormous box.  They could easily shop it in a box half the size."
Not sure about the flavor but there you go everything else was fine LOL,I would say it was a Purina standard quality anymore it's hard to tell a lot about the extra ingredients unless you are a chemistry majorBut overall a normal Healthy dog should thrive on this Pro Plan
Five Stars! Very convenient!,"I can’t speak to the nutritional quality of the dog food (because I am certainly no expert). However, my dogs eat it, and I have *heard* that vets recommended this dog food to some of my friends. You really can’t beat the convenience factor, though. It is so much easier when these big bags of dog food are delivered to your front door in such a quick manner than having to go to the store yourself! The price point is great, too!"
Next time ask your dog what they like to eat,Whether it’s Me or my dogs but when we bought this product which is an upgrade from what they’ve been eating they won’t even touch it
Problems with multiple dogs vomiting once we started getting Pro Plan from Amazon. *Updated,"*Tried two more bags from Amazon, and so far haven't had the vomiting problems. However, I'm lowering my rating to one star,potentially for something out of Purinas control, but it needs to be said.I paid $29.99 per bag just a couple months ago, today it's $39.99 per bag (and I need two). Are you kidding me? This isn't sustainable for me, so I'm off to Walmart.----------------------------------I have three dogs - two 50 pounders, and a little 15 pounder. We have used Pro Plan for years, buying it from PetSmart. I got fed up with PetSmart constantly being out of it, so I checked out Pure Balance from Walmart and found it to have comparable if not better ingredients. HOWEVER, Walmart kept running out of it(!).Got more fed up with brick and mortar retailers, so I reluctantly tried Amazon for Pro Plan. Price can wildly fluctuate, but it's still the same or lower (usually) than PetSmart. And always in stock.The problem - two dogs starting vomiting. $300 worth of vet bills later, nothing was found. They got better. Now the third one is vomiting, and the other two sporadically have issues. The only common denominator is Amazon's Pro Plan food. I can't imagine Amazon gets their supply from anyone different than PetSmart, but who knows. It's not expired, the bags look fine, but it just seems too coincidental that all of the dogs (historically very healthy) start vomiting all around the same time.It's the internet, so take my feedback with a grain of salt, but I think I'm going to go back to Pure Balance from Walmart. Cheaper, and I'll just need to stock up a little better."
Dogs love it,Great value
"Formula changed a few months ago, my dogs got sick and stopped eating, my golden retriever died","My dogs have been on this food for almost 4 years. I thought about 4 months ago that only the bag design had changed and could not find anything on the formula having changed. When I opened a new bag about a 2 and 1/2 months or so ago, my dogs started vomiting after eating, then wouldn't touch the food at all. I thought it was their vitamins since I had opened a new package of that also. Then one dog (golden retriever) started leaving food in her bowl which she has never done in 10 years!! Then when both dogs stopped eating completely, I began researching and found hundreds of FB posts  (on the Purina page) and Reddit posts about other peoples dogs getting sick! This was a good brand until they changed the formula. Although I changed the food, it was too late for my golden retriever and she ended up with kidney failure within a month after I fed her that food and ended up dying last month. Since I don't have definitive proof it was the food, I can't really blame them, but I am highly suspicious since both dogs got sick at the same exact time and stayed sick until I got them onto different food."
My dog really likes it and it’s a good quality dog food,My 1 yr old dog just switched from puppy food to adult dog food. We tried other brands that she didn’t care for but really likes this one
Wrong food in bag,"The bag was labeled shredded, but it is not the shredded food. It is mislabeled. My dog won't eat it, but when she tries, she throws it up. I would appreciate another bag of the shredded food and hopefully it is correctly labeled."
Good food!,My dog has done really well with this food! I’ve tried many brands but she loves this one. I’ll keep buying it!
Something changed badly,"My 4 dogs have been on this for years. We struggled with supply issue during covid and now that it's back readily available- 2 of my 4 dogs are sick from it. They're puking, having stomach issues and are insanely itchy. I always supported this dog food but I can't after whatever they changed recently."
Quality product,My breeder actually recommended this food and my dog loves it.
My dog loved it!,My dog loved this food. She ate it and had no issues switching from puppy food to adult food.
which is a lot better than the stuff he used to get,"My boy loves this food, which is a lot better than the stuff he used to get.  You can see the chunks of chicken right in the food and I can see when he goes right after them first thing.  The quantity of the chicken pieces seems to be pretty good too.Can't say I've noticed any more energy or a better coat or anything after a few months being on this food, but I can tell her enjoys meal time more than he used to."
