0,Doesn't taste like chicken!,"OK, we all know times are tough and inflation is causing everybody to cut corners. But this tastes nothing like chicken.Meals for my family can get extremely expensive. Like every other hard working American I've been looking for a little filler to stretch our suppers out and save a few bucks. My family owes a lot to Purina. They have gotten us through tough times before. But now that my wife got promoted to weekend manager at Hardees we were looking to upgrade to a more classy supper.This Purina tastes nothing like chicken. We first tried it on Taco Tuesday but it made the tacos taste bland. The next day we tried the Purina with potatoes and green beans but Purina just soaked up the gravy and got soggy. It didn’t even make good gravy stock. Disappointing. The final straw was our tater tot hotdish. I used the Purina instead of hamburger but again it just soaked up the cream of mushroom and got soggy.The only saving grace is that my five year old enjoys Purina with chocolate milk for her morning cereal. Unfortunately, it’s going to take her a year to eat through a 50 pound bag, which I don’t mind, but the mice keep going in the bag stealing some kernels. Who has time to flick off mice poop every meal? We have been letting her eat her Purina cereal for all three meals but that’s not healthy for a growing kid either.Added bonus…….My daughter's hair looks amazing after a month of eating Purina cereal. Her long brown hair shines and flows like a donkey's mane. She looks like a young Nancy Reagan.For those of you with teenage daughters, feel free to check out my review for Fancy Feast Natural Trout and Tuna. My 16 year old started eating a can for lunch and supper for two months and she looked amazing in her prom dress."
1,Purina Pro Plan with Probiotics!,I buy this for my dog who is about 13 years old. He is not usually picky and he likes this food a lot. He has some issues with sore joints at his age and with the probiotics and other ingredients in this food it seems to help with his joints. This food is better than what I gave him before.
2,Amazing product,Received this product today while putting it in the containers my dogs came up and couldn’t keep their mouths out of the container trying to eat it I gave him a little sample and they kept coming back for more and more even my cats were begging for some reading the reviews I see there’s problems with this have to keep my eyes open but so far so good
3,Product is fine - delivery stunk.,"Our dog really loves this food.  My only gripe is the delivery person left it outside about 100 yds from our house.  It's a heavy bag and if it would have rained while we were not home, the whole bag of food would have been ruined.  I was generous to give it four stars but I don't want to give the manufacturer a bad rating since the product is good.  If the delivery issue is not resolved, I will be cancelling my recurring order."
4,My dogs love it,Bought because of the healthy ingredients. We have dogs from 35 pounds down to 5 pounds and they all love the taste. One of our dogs is a finicky eater and she loves the taste of this food. My dogs seem to not have any issues with the size texture or digestion. I recommend this food. The price is not issue for us as we want our dogs to have a healthy choice of food.
5,My dogs love this food!!!,"This came highly recommended by my vet, and I agree that it's a great product. All the essentials my dogs need, and they love the taste! Highly recommend."
6,Vet recommended and it’s soft on sensitive tummies.,Like that I can trust food.  USA made is a plus we’ll no it’s mandatory for my group.
7,My dogs have always looked great on Proplan,My dogs have loved Proplan since I first started buying it in 1985. I’ve tried other premium food but always come back to Proplan.
8,My dogs love it!,My dogs love it!
9,Good for pet,"This is a good food, it has alot of natural ingredients in it."
10,Picky dogs loved it,Have a really picky husky couldn’t keep her nose out of the bag. Don’t quote me on it but I think there’s actual chicken in the kibble? Looks like it’s maybe freeze dried. The dogs couldn’t get enough of what ever it is.
11,Woof woof,"Well I didn't eat it personally but my dogs did so according to them, woof woof"
12,A little pricey,A little pricey/ how ever it is a good middle of the road food for my dog. It isn’t the cheapest- poor quality and not the most expensive- high  quality …. It’s in the middle. My dog loves the chucks of chicken in it.
13,Great food,Very convenient to have it auto ship. My dog loves it
14,Something's changed and it's NOT GOOD!!!,I have been using this brand of dog food for 20 months.  Something has changed!  I have 3 dogs.  Had to take one to the vet for vomiting & diarrhea.  Two days later another dog is sick with vomiting & diarrhea.  Today third dog is having diarrhea.  It has to be the dog food.  I will be contacting Purina as this is a new bag that was opened & the cost is $80.  So far I have $420.00 in vet bill for one dog.  I'll need to call my vet about the other two and who knows what this will cost me in the end.  Purina Pro Plan you made my dogs sick!!!  Do something before other dogs are sick too.
15,Purina Pro Plan Dog Food,I normally feed this brand and formula.  The kibble size is just right for all the dogs to manage.  This had gone way up in price since I first purchased it but is still cheaper than retail stores.
16,55lb pound dog-47 lb bag lasts 3 months,Our Pitty Mix loves this food and we were able to save some money by subscribing.  One bag lasts us about 3 monthd (she’s gets 2 cups of food a day).
17,The choice for both my dogs!,"I switched to Nutro to save money and take advantage of a deal and paid the price! Both dogs wouldnt eat it, threw out bowls of uneaten kibble night after night.  Both started easting grass like crazy and my puppy began itching all over.  I went back to Proplan and threw out the Nutro!They both licked their bowls clean the first night and every night since!  My puppy will eat the kibble without any wet or chicken added.  That speaks volumes!Thank you for making a great product Purina, amidst the pandemic where most companies are finding ways to cut corners!"
18,Better price than TSC,My dog had no complaints!
19,Shipped on time,Dog food shipped on time.I didn't know our farm store sold the same thing for the same price. No savings.St Bernard loves the food.
20,Bowels are normal not loose,"As of. Ow I liked it better because bowels are normal instead or loose running. Also, She doesn’t fart or burp as much."
21,Recommended by my vet,I’ve been using Purina Pro Plan for several years. My dog began licking his paws a lot and  I read that the probiotic brand often reduced the licking and it certainly did in his case. I would certainly recommend it.
22,Shipping - box crrushed,Product shipped too large of a box - mine was crushed in all over and torn open with small pierced hole in bag.  Use of a more suitable size box would be a solution.  GREAT PRODUCT
23,Good quality food,"My fur babies love this brand. They prefer the lamb and rice blend, but that's been impossible to find lately."
24,Dogs love it,My dog wasnt wanting to eat their previous food anymore. We switched and now she loves this food.
25,My dog loves it,My vet recommends the is brand and my dog has never had any issues with it.
26,Best food I’ve had,We usually eat this 3 nights a week for dinner i sometimes mix it with cream of mushroom soup me and my girlfriend love it !
27,"Great Food, but messy","Food was one of those recommended by my vet because the nutrition is science based (not just based on what consumers think is best for their dog). My pup loves it, I love seeing dehydrated pieces of real chicken in there, but I have an issue with all the crumbs in it from those dehydrated bits. I use a good portion of my dog's daily food for training and while the kibble is great, obviously crumbs are not suitable for this. My pup is very smart and needs a lot of mental stimulation, so she gets her dinner in puzzle feeders to make her work for it and keep her entertained - the crumbs from this food get everywhere as she is working on her puzzles. I have been sifting the food to make sure all the small bits get into her bowl where they are more contained rather than into the puzzles, but I don't like having to take that extra step every day, so unfortunately this is not the food for us and we need to try something else."
28,It's dog food for my lady (Her name is lady),"for a 47 lb bag this is actually a good price. Got here faster than I expected too. I had gotten a 20 lb bag from the food store for my dog just to hold her over til I could get a bigger bag and that 20 lb bag was around the same price as this one which was ridiculous. But my dog loves this stuff I always try getting different flavors for her to test out to see which one's she's willing to eat and which one's she's not as fond of. I just got her a year ago rescued her from a breeder who was abusive towards her. He only gave his dogs one type of food and wanted me to pay him 80 dollars for the food which is a brand I never even heard of.She is much happier here getting her pets and loving she may be a cane corso(italian mastiff) but acts like a lap dog. I've been buying her beds,treats, all of it that she more than likely never had there. Because most breeders are very strict with their dogs about what they eat and he had her outside in a kennel which probably didn't have heating or anything. (the dude was amish and really into how to do thing's the old way aka no electric, etc.She is a good protector though she see's a random cat run passed the door or squirrel she loses her mind and barks and jumps all over. She is a sweetheart even though all she's been through. She's a big puppy inside."
29,A Good Dry Dog Food,The hydrated chicken pieces are plentiful and the spaniel loves them. this was also recommended by the vet too
30,loves the chicken bites,"I am a picky labradoodle but I like this dry dog food because it's like there are little treats in it, and then the other stuff sneaks into my mouth."
31,The Shredded chicken is what your dog will love.,"The shredded chicken mixed in with the dry kibble makes this an excellent choice for picky eaters. We were struggling to find a dry food that our dog would actually want to eat. This food was a game changer. Our pup went from turning his nose up at other foods to now happily enjoying his mealtimes. It's a good qualify food with essential vitamins and minerals, probiotics and glucosamine.I am not affiliated in any way with the seller or brand. This is my own personal review and recommendation. 😊"
32,Dogs love it.,Funny that one of the questions in the review is flavor.  I have to trust my dogs on this answer. I asked and the both told me it tasted good.  They then asked if they could have ice cream since they cleaned their plates. I can't argue with that.
33,My dogs love it.  Can't wait until meal time.,My dogs have shiny soft fur and don't itch or scratch.They get so excited when it's time to eat.
34,My dog’s favorite,Pro Plan was recommended by our trainer many years ago and it’s the only brand we feed. Our boy is a picky eater but he likes this food and he’s 12 yrs old and fortunately super healthy so we think this food is the best.
35,Purina pro plan,"Purina pro plan,todo esta excelente sabor,frescura mi nieta perrita preciosa le gusta,lo qu no me gusto es que dejaron la funda abajo de mi edificio y no la subieron arriba dónde vivo"
36,Very crumbly,"Food is probably very good, but makes a mess when you put it in a treat toy because it’s so crumbly.  Also, I have to pick out the bigger irregular shaped bits because they don’t come out of the toys easily."
37,Our dog's favorite,Our dogs love this food and have been maintaining a good healthy weight.
38,Doggy loves it,"My dog is picky, he actually enjoys this food and it is vet recommended. Purchased on Amazon due to tractor supply being out of stock of it over last few months"
39,Allergy,We have always used the Purina Pro plan for our dogs since they were small.  I read about this probiotics and shredded chicken product and thought it worth trying even though it's pricey!  We got 3/4 thru the bag and my Golden retriever started to chew and lick so much that he began to get raw hot spots.  I can't say this will happen to all dogs. but my two dogs had a terrible itching situation that sent me to the Vet for the hot spots from licking and itching.  I think this product should be reviewed by Purina and see what is causing the itching to prevent this situation in the future.
40,Not sure about the flavor but the dog seems to enjoy it!,Dog eats this well.
41,Tasty!,I really enjoy this food either by itself or with milk. It’s both crunchy and savory. Perfect start to the day!
42,"Switched from higher-end brands, dogs happier and healthier","Over the last few decades we have always fed our dogs high-end dog foods like Taste of the Wild, Canidae, Orijen, etc. However, we would also regularly have digestive issues (diarrhea, constipation, loudly burbling stomachs, bloat, etc), and we would end up doing things like supplementing with pumpkin, vet visits, and other measures.We recently moved and got a new vet, and took one of our dogs in with one of their regular digestive issues. The vet said, look, these high-end foods are usually great, however by their nature they don't have stable suppliers of their esoteric ingredients, so their formulations tend to vary from batch to batch, and a varying diet is a primary contributor to dog digestive issues.After he said this I expected him to push Science Diet, which is what virtually all my past vets have done, and he had bags of it stacked on shelves in his waiting room - but he didn't. He said, try Purina Pro Plan, it's high-end enough to have quality ingredients, but mass-market enough to have stable suppliers and consistent composition over time.We were skeptical, but figured it was worth a shot, so we transitioned our dogs to Purina Pro Plan, and sure enough, their digestive issues have almost completely disappeared. They also remain happy, active, and healthy, with good coats, and don't have lethargic bouts of growling tummies on a regular basis. Note that we have a pretty diverse canine population, ranging from Corgies to mutts to hounds to Rottweilers, and it's worked great for all of them.We did this a few months ago and things are still good, so we're convinced. It still drives me nuts that grocery stores won't carry (what we consider to be) decent dog food, so we have to go to the feed store or PetSmartCo for the Pro Plan, and occasionally I'll buy it here on Amazon (and they ship it Prime, which is nice).Note that we love our dogs and would happily pay more for consistent, high-quality dog food, but we just haven't found it, and we are surprised converts to Purina Pro Plan."
43,My dog likes it,My dog really likes it so I will keep buying it. My vet says Purina is a brand I can trust. Wish it was a little less expensive but it’s far from the most expensive dry food.
44,Pleasing to my pups palette,"My pup loves this flavor. We were feeding him the lamb flavor before and he would eventually finish his food but with this flavor, he is so excited for meal time and finishes his food."
45,Dogs seem to like it.,"Dogs have no problem eating it up, seems to be made from pretty decent ingredients."
46,Excellent Customer Service,"I am new to amazon prime and have been very impressed with my experience thus far. I have ordered several items and am amazed how quickly things arrive to my home which is in a town of 4000 people. I have an 8 year old 100-lb golden retriever and have been using purina pro plan for his entire life. Today I received my second delivery of this dog food through Amazon and unfortunately it had a slit in the side of the bag from what appears to be a box cutter that resulted in the dog food being all over the inside of the box. This was the first item I’ve received from Amazon that was damaged and not having a ton of experience with Amazon as well as being frustrated that the dog food arrived in this condition, I went to the chat function for customer service to tell them my experience. The customer service was extremely fast and remediated the situation in less than a minute much to my surprise. Very impressed with Amazon’s customer service and their business model. Upon receiving the package today, I was skeptical in ordering further dog food from Amazon but this quick and essentially effortless experience with customer service renewed my newfound trust in such a great company that takes care of their customers with little to no questions asked. Highly recommend anyone considering not lugging around heavy dog food bags anymore to give Amazon a try given their competitive prices and excellent customer service able to remediate any issues that are unlikely to come your way."
47,Dog Food,"Great, price is a little high"
48,Making my dog sick,"Started mixing this with my dogs old food with the plan to have him eat this moving forward, but after he started eating pro plan, he has been getting sick every day. Switched him back to his old food and seems to be doing fine."
49,My fur baby loves this!,My fur baby loves this food! Been using it for years!
50,My dog LOVES it,I feel sooo guilty. My dog is 5 years old and has never been one to get excited for meal time. Now that I have purchased this food she begs for breakfast and dinner!! My only regret is not finding and buying this sooner. 10:10 recommend!!
51,My dog loves this!,"There are a lot of dog food brands and styles that my dog likes, but the food doesn't like him.  We have had bouts of vomiting and lack of ability to control when he had to ""go"" resulting in house cleaning that interrupted plans. Any dog owner can attest that most dogs are very sensitive, not being able to vary their diets much. This food was one of the few that didn't give him problems when we moved him to it, although we did a SLOW and GRADUAL conversion, mixing it with his other food (the other food was a very cheap brand that is great on the budget, but he did not appear to be healthy or happy about it).Now, during the conversion process our dog began to sort his food, eating just this brand and leaving the original brand in the dish. He loves it, and is excited to get this food.  And he knows when the box is for him. Sort of ironic because we do not control his diet, the food is in a self feeding container that lasts a week or two at a time....he has no need to wait or be excited for it as he always has it available. However, he loves it...and does get excited. And best yet, his fur is no longer dry and breaking, and he is full of more energy.  Not so good when we don't go out often, but better for him to be healthy and energetic.Of note, do not buy large amounts of this unless you have a way to safely store it.  It does not need refrigerated or anything fancy, but when opened and exposed to the air you have about a month to use it or it starts to cause upset stomach issues in the dog.  I use a dog food container with a gamma seal for the bulk of the food so the food doesn't just sit in the air. I think it is the ""fresher"" meat that is included with the hard bits of corn and fiber.  It doesn't rot, per se, but it does cause issues with your pet."
52,Very INCONSISTENT product. Switched to other e-merchant.,"I keep buying this product but it is highly inconsistent.First batch food was great. The dry chicken pieces were big, smell was so good and food was fresh, moist and my basset and maltese went thru like maniacs.Second batch, was so different that I had to double check whether I ordered the same thing. Smell was chemical, chicken pieces small and super dry. Two 4-legged mutineers at home, really unhappy.Third batch, food was moist, chicked smaller and smaller. Food smell was better than 2rd batch. I found A LOT of crumbles from the kibbles in the sac. Dogs were more interested in the food this time.I am rolling the dice in 2 weeks hoping my dogs will keep eating ProPlan."
53,Better $$ than Chewy,Title says it all..today any way.
54,Only food my dog will eat,"I rescued a high-maintenance shelter dog who only ate hot human food. I tried a few different dry foods and he wouldn’t eat for days. This is the only on he chowed down so I stuck with it. One year later and my dog is energetic, healthy and happy."
55,My dog loves it,My dog loves it! But I payed double ordering thru AmazonI can buy it at Walmart for half the priceLive and learn
56,I’ve seen the reviews,"I know this food has some pretty yucky reviews in terms of freshness. While I have experienced issues of freshness when buying from my local Petco, this has not been the case when purchasing from Amazon. convenient shipping and always fresh for me."
57,Transitioned from Focus puppy to this,"Small breed puppies were on this same Purina Chicken and Rice in the puppy food.  Time to transfer, I chose this.  They transitioned just fine.  The kibble for the ""small breed"" puppies was really too small for our mini fox terrier (even though he is still only 5-6 pounds) and too small for our chi-chi.  So we went with the regular.  Avoided the ""small breed"" this time too, and it is fine."
58,Like it,My dog does not miss a beat when she eats this seems to keep her healthy
59,Good quality kibble that doesn't kill breath,My Golden loves her kibble and I try to switch up flavors for her.  This is my favorite for her because it doesn't leave her breath smelling like dead fish.
60,Best dog treats,Best dog treats ever.  I’m dog is picky about what she eats.  I found these at a local store and she loves them.  I’m so glad that I found them online.
61,The shredded parts become very crumbly,The formula agrees with my dog's digestive system really well. But the shredded parts are very crumbly. About 1/8 or more of the package is just crumbs. It works ok if you use the crumbs in a stuffed Kong but I hand feed most of my  dog's meals (for training) and it's no good for that.
62,Dogs love it!,I’ve been trying all kinds of dry food is for my babies. My mother in law sent two bags of this over and my dogs love it. Smells great and is just right for my little one to eat . If you have a finicky eater try this!!!
63,Best price with free prime shipping.,Used to buy this at PetSmart for my pooch but price kept going up.  Found this on Amazon at a better price with free prime shipping and get it in 2 days.  Appears to be fresh each time.
64,Great Brand Of Dog Food,My dog loves this stuff. My Veterinarian toldMe about it and some others to feed her. I had her on Nutro but it is on the list of dog foods online that can possibly cause heart problems in dogs. That’s when I switched. I had seen it and heard of it before and just started her on this brand since that was the first brand that the doctor told me about. I get it on here along with the cans. I had a few cans left over from the last bag I had purchased. She will even eat this dry without some of the canned in it. She’s kind of picky too. I’ll stick with this is the weight maintenance formula. She did great with that one. My dog is medium sized. She is a Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. The hard food is medium sized bites. You may want to purchase smaller bites if you go with this brand and have a smaller dog. I added 5 stars for the taste but I didn’t taste it. I wanted her to have it all to hersel but she told me it is delish! 😉
65,Our dog Sarge loves it,Sarge is a big German Shepard dog with an appetite to match. He likes the taste. The large bags make it easy to always stay on top of things.
66,Fountain of youth.,"Greatest diet change for my dog. 10 year old (retired) competition hunting English Setter. Has a new bounce to his step. Highly recommend. I was feeding him pro plan high protein and he was declining noticeably after running in the field.  A soft tissue injury from 5 years ago seems to have been eliminated when it had previously prevented him from jumping into the truck. I was very suspect about the diet change but I have seen nothing but positives after changing to this. Highly recommended, I wish I had made the switch earlier."
67,"My dogs usually love this, but...","I've been feeding this to my dogs for over a year now, and they really loved it. I did a lot of research before I switched their food, so I was pleased that they were eating such a high quality food. For the last few months, though, I've had to coax them to eat. It looks a bit different to me, too - there don't seem to be as many shreds in it as there were when we first started using it. The only time they will reliably eat it is if I mix it with something else, which I don't do often, and one of the dogs actually picked out the food I had mixed in (Fresh Pet) and spit the Purina on the floor. I really hate to switch them to another dog food because they were doing so well on this before, especially because it is so reasonably priced. I'm hoping it is a temporary change in the formula or something."
68,Amazon to the rescue for this!,My two year old goldendoodle LOVES this specific flavor of purina pro plan. Our regular subscription service was completely out in every size and it was not communicated to me until we were almost out. Amazon to the rescue and we had the food the next day!
69,Dog can’t review,If my dog could review himself I would be rich  freshness and brand trust important for me.
70,Quality dog food,2 Labs..Best ingredients
71,"Great Quality, Good Value","I like Purina Pro Plan because my Boxer & chihuahuas like it & it is a good value. The quality ingredients keep them healthy with no allergy symptoms.Purina has a good reputation for quality products & I have never had to worry about a recall. My two chihuahuas will even eat it, although the kibble is large. (All three dogs are somewhat picky eaters.) I also usually mix this food with chicken broth or chicken bone broth, a small amount of shredded cooked chicken, and an expensive freeze-dried raw beef “topper” made by TruPet/TruDog called, “Fortify Me.” I’ve had them on this regimen for about 2-3 years.The chihuahuas are 7 years old, and the boxer is 4. (Fortunately, he tolerates the little yappers pretty well considering his dominant nature. 😬)"
72,Great for our dogs!,"My sister has two larger dogs, a Australian Shepard and a Golden Retriever. They are really active and eat a lot.I just got my own Shih Tzu and opted to buy this dog food on her recommendation. It is not grain free, but she told me that some grain-free dog foods have been known to cause health issues in dogs. Given that my dog will be fine eating small amounts of bread, and seems to love rice, I thought I would give this one a go.The instructions recommend a transition period between the dog's old food and new food. Because I was nearly out of old food, I just went straight to this one, and added a little bit of salmon oil. Though I am sure he would prefer to eat people food, he really likes this combination. I buy the chicken one, but my sister buys the lamb one for her dogs as one of them has severe allergies."
73,Good Choice for Dogs of All Sizes,"This has been the only dog food we have fed our 11 year old lab- her whole life. She’s in amazing shape for her age, always gets compliments on how puppy like she is, and how soft she is- and I  wholeheartedly believe it starts with this quality food we feed her."
74,The perfect dog food!,"My pup has been eating this food for several years now.  She has always been very fond of it and eats it with no problems.  When I purchased this bag, I noticed that she was not eating it.  Upon closer evaluation of the food, it appears that there are very little if any of the chicken pieces.  This just leaves the pellets.  She will not eat it without the chicken pieces.  Very disappointed."
75,Where’s the Chicken Pieces?,I have 2 very picky eaters and I am so glad I tried this one because they both like it and will eat it without having to add any wet food! I’m not crazy about the poultry by-product meal but until I can find something more natural I will stick with this one.
76,Dogs approved,"He has been on Pro Plan Sport since he outgrew puppy food. It was the only thing I could find in a hi performance food that didn't give him terrible gas. Now that he's older and not as active, I switched him to this. His entire life, it has taken him at least 24 hours to eat his daily ration of Sport and then he would carry it all over the house to eat a mouthful at a time when he felt like it. It also gave him fish breath that would take your breath. The Savor, now that is a different story. He stands at the bowl as soon as it hits the floor and doesn't move from it until the bowl is empty. He worries me to death in the  evenings wanting to be fed now. I don't really see any difference in his energy level, hair quality, shedding, no allergies... but on the plus side, no bad breath and no gas either!"
77,My 8 year old Drahthaar loves it,"A year ago I purchased my very own full blooded Doberman. Made sure she was full blooded with the proper paperwork and everything! When you think about purchasing a pet. You're committing yourself to having this companion as your best friend at home for hopefully 10 years plus! And if you decided to get a pet friend, don't you think you would want to make sure she is happy and healthy throughout her life as well? Well ever since I've started my Doberman on this brand, She runs to the bowl which means she absolutely loves it! And I do feel that this product is keeping her very healthy and lean muscle! And now my new guest to the house is a stray Cat and knowing how well its doing for my dobie, I had to have it for my new kitten! He's on the Focus currently until he ages a little more of course. But he has nothing but joyful fun around the house. Literally can't wait to get his hands on it and stuff his face lol Damn wizard somehow opened my cabinet and nip picked at the bag until he realized that these Purina packaging is top notch. He still has his front claws and and he couldn't tear it thank god! But I would suggest this product to anyone as it has only brought me more joy knowing my pets have well nutrition and happy life styles. And absolutely love eating it! Forgot to mention really keeps their coat/fur very healthy and soft!"
78,I want the best for my pet and this is it!,"I’ve been buying Purina Pro Plan for years and my dog loves it and his coat is beautiful. However, my last order had an issue. This bag was infested with silverfish.. I didn’t notice at first and almost everyday I’d find a few silverfish running around where I keep my food. My assumption is there was a problem where the food itself was stored. This was the only time I’ve had this issue but just wanted to bring it to light. I usually buy the dog food at Petsmart and had never had this issue at Petsmart."
79,Infested with Silverfish,Product showed up open and taped shut😔
80,Bag was ripped open,"I have quite possibly the pickiest French Bulldog known to man!  I’ve tried countless food brands, all of the “artisanal” local brands, raw diet, home cooking, and my little buddy always gets bored or doesn’t like it.  I came across this Purina pro plan at the recommendation of a friend who’s vet said the quality is great.  I was shocked when my dog ate the entire bowl in a matter of seconds.  He’s done this before, but by the 2nd or 3rd day he usually becomes bored and picky.  I’ve been feeding him this food for several months now, and he still devours every meal.  I am really thankful for this food, because meal time use to be a struggle every day with my dog.  I do wish I were supporting local less known organic food brands instead of purina, but if he loves it and vets recommend it, I am ok with continuing!"
81,Even the pickiest dog loves it,I normally buy my dog food from chewy but to get free delivery I must spend $50 which requires me to purchase something I don’t have to haveI read prior reviews some giving 5 stars some only one so I thought I would give it a try.  My dog loves it and I store my dog food in a container in a open carport and have had no issues. This food has some rather large chunks in it that I use as treats.  The only problem with it is my dog likes it to much and is always wanting more.
82,My dog loves it,"I usually use science diet for my dog since when I first got him he needed to gain weight. However after a month or so, he wasnt excited to eat it and just would leave the bowl full of food all day but just love and beg for treats. I reduced his feedings, as well changing the times just incase that was a factor. I ended up having to add beef broth so he would eat it.I wanted to find a food with the same nutritional content as well as something that tasted good for him. He loves it, they have different forms of the kibble, as well as more than just one plain flavor so I can switch it up on him easily. Plus its a little cheaper than science diet which is really nice"
83,Dog Loved it great taste and nutritional value,"My dog Absolutely loves this flavor of Purina Pro Plan. I’ve been feeding him another variety of Purina Pro Plan for about 8mths now, but recently he became extremely ill with some kind of gastrointestinal sickness. He was pooping and vomiting blood, and I thought that I was going to lose him. Luckily, after $500 at the vet, he made a full recovery. While going through this whole ordeal, my vet recommended that I give him probiotics, so I decided to search for a dry dog food that contained probiotics. I was thrilled when I discovered that the brand of dog food that I was already feeding him carried a variety containing probiotics. I bought this shredded chicken variety, and like I said earlier, he absolutely loves it. I will definitely continue to feed him this variety of Purina Pro Plan unless he’s runs into some unforeseen issue with it in the future. Thank you Amazon and thank you Purina."
84,Probiotic WIN,"It was not fresh, lots of crumbs. The product was supposed to have shredded chicken mix, however it had little to none. My dog was very hesitant to eat and normally eats it enthusiastically?"
85,"It was not fresh, lots of crumbs",Our dog loves this food so much that we have to use one of the special bowls that helps him take longer to eat.
86,Our dog loves his food,"I struggled for years to find kibble my dog Suke got excited to eat, she would never eat at scheduled meal times and the food would sit in her bowl until she was starving, I had to add boiled chicken or bone broth every time. I tried all the expensive brands and bought a small bag of this one day when my scheduled delivery was late and we ran out, she loved it from the start and still gets excited for mealtime a year later. It was not a good fit for my other dog who has a sensitive stomach so he gets a different Purina Pro kibble."
87,My picky eater loves it!,It never gets old. I love having this on auto ship
88,Feeding my digs the same for more than 10 years,"If you give a crap about what your Pupper eats but can't afford raw or super elite this is 100% where to go. My last dog the salmon pink bag is ALL she could eat. Anything else she'd have a reaction of some exciting sort. My current dummy eats non stop. Feeding him only the excellent stuff would literally break me. I mix this with a grain free top of the line stuff and he's satisfied and healthy without me taking out a loan for dog food 🙄. Its healthy and gives them what they need without the junk. My dummy is a spoiled athletic prince but my ""beginning adulthood dog"" was healthy for a long time on this. When I needed help with my now baby's diet this was an easy choice."
89,Great option!,"As far as quality I choose Purina over other brands because with a little research its easy to see that many brands are not much more than a name attached to cheap or worse, dangerous, non-USA crap wrapped in fancy branding. My vet agrees so we go with the well know name of the food that have been feeding animals for decades. As far as acceptance our experience has been as follows:  I had been buying Purina Small dog Chicken with strips for my 1 year old Morkie and 1 year old HavaPoo and they LOVE IT The Havapoo inhales it and the dainty Morkie guards and slowly eats her share as the Havapoo tries for seconds. My wife suggested that we change things up because they ""might be getting bored"" of the same thing. Well, they are definitely less eager to the lamb or chicken without the strips flavor so the moral of the story... don't fix it until they wont eat it."
90,Both my dogs Love Purina but they didnt like Lamb flavor or the Chicken without strips,He eats it
91,My dog loves this,They don’t eat any other brand!
92,My Great Danes love it,Lazer loves this food!!! I am glad Amazon carries it. Always speedy delivery
93,Fast delivery,My dog literally drools when I go to scoop this.PPP is a high quality kibble I suggest to anyone. My dog was on purina one for awhile but after doing research I did the swtich. Her eyes have never been bright and her coat and never been shinier. Plus because it's high quality I use less. One bag lasts my 85 lb mutt for about 2 months. Buy this if you care about giving your dog the best but also have a budget to keep to. You dont need to spend 80 dollars on food to have a beautiful and healthy dogAdded pic of how my dog looks after two months on PPP
94,Best kibble you can buy,"ROSCOE’S REVIEW - I’m an Italian Greyhound/Chihuahua and am very finicky when it comes to food, but I love the taste of the shredded chicken Pro Plan. Yum! I give it 4 pawsHALO’S REVIEW - I’m a Pomeranian and I’m not finicky at all. Give me any type of food and I’ll eat it, but my Mom, my HUMAN MOM, she’s a vet tech and she only feeds us Purina Pro Plan. She says it’s the best food. She’s had dogs before us and has always fed them this. Even our feline sister gets Pro Plan."
95,Veterinary Technician Recommended,"The very first ingredient is real chicken, not chicken by-product.  In fact, this formula of dog food has very little by-product in it.  My wife and I believe it's some of the best dog food around.  Our dogs are all happy, healthy, energetic, and have shiny coats, so we must be doing something right.The dogs love this food.  It has real pieces of chicken mixed in and they all have developed a unique way to eat it - they take a mouthful at a time and drop it on the floor.  They then separate the real chicken pieces from the rest and eat those first.  After the real chicken is gone, then they clean up the mess from the floor.  Gotta get the good stuff first, I guess.  It's sort of comical to watch.The Amazon Prime price on this dog food is on par with buying it at a brick-and-mortar pet store locally, so it's not a super-deal in that regard.  What it does have going for it, though, is the advantage of being delivered right to our door step.  Since my wife and I both work, not needing to take time out to go to shopping for this food makes this deal very compelling."
96,Good quality dog food delivered right to your door!,"I belong to a lot of dog breed specific FB groups (Golden Doodle) and they all say overwhelmingly that Purina Pro Plan is one of the best dog foods on the market today. Our dog loves it and as long as it continues to get rave reviews from the members of my groups, we'll be sticking with it."
97,Our Dog Loves It,"I have bought this dog several times . The chicken is not in it anymore just crumbs of chicken.  DISGUSTED!! WITH PRICE AS IT IS NOW QUALITY IS CRAP !!  people can't afford to have a pet . We are regular people and can't eat a steak it's to expensive. Do you really need this much !!! greed is a terrible thing. How sad . I won't be buying your dog food anymore. No thank you ! Don't suggest anyone else buy it,not worth the money at all."
98,Greedy people!!,"I have a pitbull mix and he has been picky with his dog food lately. I must admit, I would notice that he wouldn't eat his dog food, so I would give him table food, but it's gotten to the point where he holds out on his own food because he knows he'll get table food from me. Well, when I put some of this food in his food bowl, he instantly eat all of it. I've fed him 3 times so far, and each time he has eaten his own food while my son and I have been at the table eating our own food. Any other time he would've been right beside us begging for food, so we can definitely tell that he loves his doggy food!"
99,My dog loves it!,"I have 2 dogs that are very old, like me. I had been feeding them Purina Pro Plan dog food for a long time. I was reading about different dog foods and decided to make a healthier change. They did not like the change. At all!  Even though the new food is supposed to be a good food and healthy, If they won't eat it, it isn't the right one for us. Pro Plan has chicken pieces in it and I see those pieces that they have freeze dried. The dog food pieces are mostly round with the chicken pieces in it. I was really getting concerned that one of my girls was getting her ribs showing again. I also have probiotics for dogs and when this bag came, I started mixing a scoop of it in the food. I am supposed to wet the food to dissolve the powder. They are thrilled with both. They are licking the bowls when there is no food left. I think it is wonderful to try to feed your dogs healthy food but this is the one I will always buy from now on. It is a great product! Thanks Purina"
100,like me. I had been feeding them Purina Pro ...,"We buy this dog food for our dog Macy, she's a Lab German Shepherd mix she's a good sized girl. At first she didn't seem to like this food but after a few days she would eat this food and keep going until her bowl is clean. As far as the health benefits seem to go this food is definitely a good quality food, I do not care if it is grain-free or if it has grain in it a lot of grain-free foods are absolutely horrible for dogs. We've been feeding this food to our girl for about three months and she's now shedding less, more energetic and the probiotics in this blend of food really seem to help her with a few of her other issues. I can't recommend this food enough to people, especially if I hear them say they're feeding their dog a cheap low quality food."
101,Great healthy dog food,My dogs love this it helped them stay satisfied
102,Best dog food,"This product is recommended by the vet. This is the only dog food that my dog eats alone, with no other foods mixed in it. I also, bought it for my friends dog, who has the same problem. And he loves it and can eat just dry dog food alone. This dry dog food must be good, because they can  now eat it with nothing mixed in it. Thy love the freshness and flavor, which makes the quality ingredient the best."
103,Best dry dog food recommended by the vet,The price just goes up and up every month. Not worth the “repeat delivery” because you don’t get anything off. I will just go to the store and pay the same price.
104,Just ok,"This dog food has been life changing for our Boston Terrier. She’s 11, and we’ve been feeding her another “high end” brand of dog food for most of her life, until the recent no-grain dog food brands and link to heart disease news came out. Our vet recommended a list of 2-3 different foods to switch to. We tried this one first, thinking dog food is dog food, but WOW... She has morphed from a slower, senior-acting dog to a frisky and playful pup again! We feed all 3 of our dogs this food (Chihuahua, Boston and Catahoula) and couldn’t be happier. All the dogs love the little meat bits and never leave the kibble uneaten. They love it. We are so happy that this product changed our old dog’s life and made her happier and healthier. Thank you!!!"
105,Gave my old dog new life,Had to switch back to Rachael Ray for my lab didn’t like it a stopped eating and lost weight. Could count his ribs.My niece is a vet and recommends the Pro Plan but he didn’t care for it. My mutt loved it.
106,One dog loved it. The other hated it and lost weight,"First let me say that I have purchased this dog food for both of my dogs for the last 6 years. So I am a LOYAL purina pro plan customer and have only ever used this brand. We have always loved it…until the last couple of months. I’ve ALWAYS had their food stored in airtight containers, but recently I noticed there was bugs and worms in the food. Like not just a few bugs….I mean like infested with bugs and worms. So because I’m such a loyal customer that has loved purina, I thought there’s no way it could be the manufacturer’s fault. I figured I just needed to buy new vacuum sealed containers and that maybe my current containers had an issue. Let me also say that my house is incredibly clean and we don’t have any bugs anywhere else in the house. So I spent money on the top of the line food containers designed to keep out bugs. Then, I checked when I opened a new bag of purina, and I saw the bugs in the bag before I even poured it into my container. That’s when I knew the bug/worm infestation was not our container problem…but a Purina problem. I reported it to amazon and got a refund. Then, I still purchased more purina because I figured maybe it was just a bad batch. Well, now my last 2 orders also had bugs. One of them is outside the return window so I’m frustrated. Honestly my dogs love this food so if I get a response from Purina with how they are going to fix this, I am willing to remain a customer because I know mistakes happen. But if not, I’m going to have to transition my dogs to a different food unfortunately. Or maybe buy it directly from Petco and not amazon?"
107,buyer beware,Food is great delivery and handling is awful.  Been buying this for over two years and it is consistently late or doesn't show up at all and needs to be reordered.
108,DELIVERY IS LATE 95% OF THE TIME BECAUSE THE DRIVERS HATE THE HEAVY BAGS ORDER EARLY!!,Dr recommend this for my dog who’s been having trouble with diarrhea and urinating. So far so good
109,Dr recommend,"My vet recommended this brand several years ago and I stopped using it, one of my dogs have IBS this is the only food that doesn't upset his stomach, this is a great dog food. I have six dogs and they all like it."
110,Veterinary,Please use use instead of usps.  My female postal carrier leaves my 47lb bag at the post office.
111,Good food for your pet,"Mi perrito tiene 16 años y le gusta mucho esta comida, me imagino que tiene buen sabor, yo no lo he probado..!! Jejeje 😆"
112,Great dog food,"When we got our small Sheltie from a breeder (we happily adopted a pup who didn't meet their ""show dog"" standards - but she is perfect to us) they used this brand of food and we continued, first with the puppy formula and now for adults. Our vet approved us continuing and we alternate the chicken a beef with morning/dinner feedings. We like that it has the shredded pieces included to give some variety to traditional kibble. A big bag of each lasts for months/almost a year, so it really isn't too much to spend. Tried the Amazon delivery this time rather than lugging it home from PetCo. I felt for our post woman who had to lug it out of her mail truck, because it is heavy at 35 pounds. At least she pulled up in our driveway to get it out. It sure was convenient for me, and the price the same or slightly less as going to PetCo. I'd give it 5 stars if my Sheltie could talk and give more feedback."
113,A mi perro le gusta,Dog foid
114,Sheltie eats it up,"My dog (coonhound) just turned 3 and every brand I have tried of dog food, she let's sit for hours. I always thought she was a weird dog since she wouldn't scarf down her food or she would walk away after I poured food in her dish. someone told me about this kind so we tried it. She loves it! I have never seen her this excited over food before. She knew what was in the box as soon as I brought it in. She started wagging her tail very excited for dinner."
115,Dog food,"To my husband and I has come our newly adopted Australian Cattle Dog, Ralph, he is 5 years old and he's wonderful!  He's been through the Missouri Puppies for Parole program, offered to prisoners in the State of Missouri.  He LOVES PURINA PRO PLAN DRY FOOD, SAVOR.  His foster mother said "" get Purina Pro Plan for him"".  He is house trained, comes, sits, stays and walks like a champion with me, I am 70 years old.  I jumped into Amazon and found Purina Pro Wet and Dry food for him AND it's PRIME.  The boxes arrived just as I expected. He eats Chicken and Rice.  He's about 44 pounds and at the fosters instruction I give him 1 1/4 cup dry and about 2 big tbls. Wet - 2 X a day.  I mix the wet with a about 1/4 cup very warm water, to make a gravy and then add 1 1/4 cup dry, then mix again.  RALPHY LOVES PURINA!!!!  And I don't have to worry about him being poisoned with foreign foods.  Our last Cattle Dog lived 17 years, with good care and Purina.  WE LOVE PURINA PRO PLAN."
116,My dog loves it!,I gave my dog his first bowl and he loved it! He was almost dancing while he ate! I got him more and he ate a few bites and was full. He went and laid by the bag before I picked it up and poured it in the food storage container. I’ve never seen a dog so happy to get off of a high dollar puppy food and go to adult food. This stuff is amazing!
117,WE GET A GOLD STAR AND SO DOES PURINA!,I have switched my dog to this type of dog food this past year and she seems to like it more and has been doing well stomach wise BUT the last two times I have ordered this from Amazon I have had a problem with the packaging. Please check your bag well. I have ordered numerous times from them and haven't had an issue till the end of November and now in middle of december. First bag had hole (box was fine so it was placed in box with a hole) and I went to return and they replaced it and said not to return which was great and the bag I got was fine. This time the bag wasn't vacuumed sealed and when you look from the top it has a hole! I called Amazon this time and of course customer service is always good and is refunding me (gave me option of getting replaced again but this is the 2nd time so I will go to the store from now on). I called to see if they could make sure this is fixed but I am also posting this to make sure others can see this is really inspect your dog food. Who knows what could get in the bag if theres a hole. Bugs or it could be stale.The dog food itself is good so far. Has little bits of dried meat in it which my dog loves and her sensitive stomach has been good with it.I love Amazon and I'm sure its not every bag of dog food and it could be purinas packaging because this time it was the sealing of the bag but just be careful.
118,Must Taste Great!,"We have feed our 11 yo Aussie iVet for years.He started to refuse to eat. And we've been worried.Finally, I contacted his breeder, and she recommended ProPlan.He literally TORE INTO THE BAG.  He wolfed it down. It was such a relief.She said ""Oh wait for his coat to come in - it's going to really improve and you'll notice a big difference.""Purina is a company you can trust.  Unlike ""Blue Buffalo"" which my friend a vet and also our OWN vet said to avoid like, crazy.Thank goodness, we've been worried so much.Thanks Purina."
119,Hole in one bag and not sealed right in another,and my dog could not be healthier.  All the issues she was having with diarrhea and upset stomach on Blue Buffalo have gone away.  Sensitivity to certain snacks and treats has gone away.  She was never excited about eating Blue Buffalo but now she loves meal times.  I so regret wasting money on such an expensive food before.  And I stock with it because people claimed it was a good food.I did a lot of research on Purina and other dog foods.  I got advice from two vets locally.  And I am very happy I made this choice and I believe my puppy is too.
120,Finally. He loves it.,My spaniel seems to prefer the Purina beef or lamb options.
121,I have now been using this dog for for over a month,"The product was fine .The price not only went up, but the delivery was late . This ended up costing me more money because my dogs ran out of food .I had to go to a store and purchase food until the delivery day. I may end up canceling this automatic purchase because it's going to cost more than buying it locally. I'm worried that the late delivery might happen again ."
122,Not his favorite but acceptable,Gave my dogs diarrhea
123,Price increase and late delivery  = hungry dogs .,"Not top of the line food by any means, but also not the bottom of the line either.  It is a good middle ground food and my dogs seem to do well on it.  I have been feeding it for over a year now.  I may switch it up soon to another flavor, but will stick with Purina Pro Plan as I know they do ALL the testing and follow all the guidelines for good quality food."
124,Gas,"Started my Aussiepoo & my Pyrenees puppy out on the Pro Plan, based on conversations with trainers & a number of veterinarians. They like it, they have had nothing else and they strive on it. What else can be said? Regular check up, Heartgard, Bravecto, etc. They are part of the family. ...both are 2 years old. One Farm Dog & One Lap Dog"
125,Decent food,"Always a vast amount of dried chicken in it, and my dogs stand there and wait for me to cut open the fresh bag every time! Very satisfied, has eliminated my dogs stomach issues, and they love it. Now they refuse to eat any other food. Haha!"
126,Started my Aussiepoo & my Pyrineese puppy out on the Pro Plan.,"We needed a new and one that had good ingredients. The vet suggested Purina pro or royal Canine and we went with this since it was cheaper. It had chunks of dried chicken in it which my pup loves. After a full bag of this I’ve seen her energy, coat and body composition change drastically for the better. Although it’s more expensive it is actually good for your pups and worth it! Buy the bigger bags on sale and put it on auto ship which also gives you a discount"
127,My dogs love this,"Our dogs love this Purina product, flavor and freshness are qualities not found on other products.We recommend this."
128,My dog lives for this,"My dog is a lazy little apartment dweller, and always on the lookout for a snack, so keeping her at a healthy weight is a challenge - there's not much leeway weight-wise when you are a 15 pound dog. She didn't like most canned or dry food, whether from the store or the vet, so she begged all the time. Our vet recommended this food, and even said we should order it at Amazon because it is hard to find on the store shelves here.That vet surely knows his stuff. My dog tore into the first bowl of this food like it was her first meal in days. Over the last three vet visits, her weight has stayed exactly the same. The food is easy to digest, so there is a lot less waste to pick up. The main ingredient is chicken, which is probably a lot better for a carnivore than a corn-based food. She's really cut down on the begging, too. I guess because she is getting better nutrition, she's probably not as hungry all the time. We didn't have to introduce the food gradually, either. Just switched to the new food, no stomach upset or any other trouble.Try it - your dog will thank you! Well, actually, the dog will probably just eat, but you'll know he'd thank you if he could!"
129,Flavor is foremost!,Thank you.
130,"Recommended by our vet, and wow, was he right!","I switched my senior dog to this brand a few months ago. Not only does he eat more regularly, and immediately, he is more energetic and has a shinier coat. Very pleased customer!"
131,My dog really likes to eat it.,Doggo is sick of kibble but this one he eats with pleasure. Will keep purchasing
132,Senior dog love it!,"vet recommended this food for my dog due to her past diet and heart issues. she immediately started eating this, when she’s not a good-oriented dog. never seen her try food and continue to eat it as soon as it’s down! she loves this stuff."
133,Dog loves it,"My dog was eating Pure balance from Walmart, and he was having a lot of allergies during the day. The doctor recommended this brand as his fur was really suffering with his allergies. He is doing pretty good with this brand since then. This was the third time I got his food from Amazon, and the only time I had issues with it was the second time, when I could not find any of the shreds inside of the food. This one was pretty much good so we are happy with this purchase."
134,My Dog Loves This!,"We switched to this brand from Blue Buffalo on a recommendation from our vet and others. Before, our dog was so sluggish and had no energy. He would let his food sit and only take small nibbles of the food. Now, as soon as he hears me scooping this food into his bowl he comes running and stands there and gobbles the entire bowl down and looks for me when he's done! He also is much more energetic! Within a month of eating the new food, his coat has gotten so much more soft and shiny. Definitely will be purchasing another bag!"
135,Good food,"The measure of a good seller is customer service response when there is an issue. The 5 stars are for this supplier (as not been consuming food long enough to rate that yet) as other comments cover well the attributes of the Pro Plan food itself.There was an issue with order fulfillment. The supplier's response was not only swift but supportive as well. Also when researching prior to 1st purchase, seeing supplier's response to issues discussed in comments I thought was very cool.The Bright Mind line is admittedly a major hardship for me as a disabled person to afford, however this supplier was so awesome and reception to the food so far has been positive I plan to switch my cats to the Pro Plan Focus line as well and purchase thru this supplier if at all possible. My furchildren may eat better than I do -- and they are totally worth it. Completing transactions with this seller is as well.Hope this was helpful in making a decision."
136,Our dog loves it!,"I have a cocker spaniel and at mixed breed that both enjoy this food greatly.  My mixed breed is a VERY picky eater.  She would only eat her kibble if it had some ""extra"" in it - gravy, pan drippings, chopped up real meat, etc.  Plain kibble and she would walk away and only eat when she was ""desperate"".  We tried 4 or 5 different ""fancy"" brands one of those had freeze dried meat bits in it. She loved that one ( was super expensive!).  So my wife found this and we've been golden ever since!We've caught our cat picking out the chicken bits in it when the dog wasn't looking as well."
137,Excellent Supplier!,"My dogs love the all Pro Plan flavors, but this is their favorite. My fellas are persnickety in their eating habits, but I have no problem getting them to eat Pro Plan. It's easy on my old guy's stomach, the younger one sucks it down like his belly is rubbing a hole in his backbone, and it provides value with respect to the amount of protein per cup.I care about how much yard I need to clean up weekly, Pro Plan does not promote pooping like some foods do. The feeding is economical (2.5-3 cups for a 50 lb dog) and I have less to clean up in the yard after. My niece's dogs like it too, when I'm dog-sitting. I purchase the 35-pound package, and it lasts 5-6 weeks. The subscription service is offered so that I get it automatically in time for one bag to run out just as I get the new one."
138,Both my dogs and even my cat enjoy this food!,                    The media could not be loaded.
139,Perfect dog food for my guys in an economical package. Subscription shipping meets my needs nicely!,                
140,He Loves It!, I highly recommend this dog food. The video speaks for itself. The freshness and flavor is apparently off the chain by the reaction of our Debo and his piggy oinks while devouring the very 1st bowl I got him. He doesn't ever do that either.
141,Donated to local shelter.,Must be good stuff since Animal  shelter recommended.  Not sure of the taste since I don’t eat dog food.  Tried a dog biscuit about 60 years ago.  Didn’t care for it.  Appears to have lots of protein and was advertised by Westminster Kennel Club.
142,More than just your regular boring bites -,"I just love eating dog food, it's quick on the go and really convenient. Kidding, kidding. My friend recommended this food after I adopted my dog just a month or so ago (she's going on 8 months now). Her dog has been eating it for awhile and well my dog loves it too. It's nice to see other chunks besides just the boring ""dog food"" bites -- the freeze dried yumms that you usually pay extra for at the pet store. This is very affordable and seems to be a high quality food that my dog absolutely loves. I wouldn't say she's a picky eater  by any means so I can say it's a win for all dogs; however, something tells me the extra bits likely help. I plan on buying this for many years to come (hopefully it stays around that long)."
143,LATEST BATCH IS MAKING MY DOGS SICK!!!,"After years of buying this product for our dogs, which was recommended by several vets, our dogs are now getting sick with vomit and diarrhea, waking us up several times at night to have to make a run for it. We thought they may be eating something outside, but we've watched them for a couple of months to make sure they weren't, during which we took them off of the food for weeks at a time, feeding them cooked chicken and rice, instead. They were doing great while on that diet, but as soon as we put them back on the Purina Pro Plan, the fun started all over again, almost immediately. After several times testing this, because we couldn't understand how this could happen, after all of our dogs have been eating this for years, we are taking them off of this food. It's unfortunate because we subscribed to it to save and stay on track, so I have another big bag of it, but it's worth the loss to not have our boys sick. I've read numerous other stories online about similar issues with this food, so we're done.I'm going to reach out to the customer service to see if they're willing to take the unopened bag we currently have back, or not."
144,"Purina Pro Plan with Probiotics Shredded Blend High Protein, Adult Dry Dog Food Chicken & Rice",My dogs love this food!
145,Good dog food and value,"A couple of our dogs are sensitive to just about every ingredient in most dog foods. So we've tried a lot of brands and flavors. So far this one seems like it has been the easiest on our dogs' stomachs and they really like it. And it is considerably cheaper than most brands we've been through. That's a good thing, since 3 of them are over 65 pounds. My only negative would be that the food ships in an enormous box. They could easily shop it in a box half the size."
146,Saves you from carrying out to your car,"Been feeding this to my Molly since she went off of puppy food. This price is about the same as Petsmart but I don’t have to drive to the store load, pay and carry out to my car. Convenience and cost what’s not too like"
147,beef and lamb ProPlan Savor for my Great Dane and Great Dane mix,"I purchase the chicken, beef and lamb ProPlan Savor for my Great Dane and Great Dane mix, they both look forward to me filling their bowls with it every day and both maintain a healthy weight.  Their vet feeds it to their dogs as well so I feel confident this is as good a choice as you can make for someone on a budget that wants to feed their dogs decent food-- that being said, I wish it came in bigger than 35lbs, occasionally if I buy it at the store I can get a bag with an ""extra 10%"" and it lasts a little while longer, but for over $1 a pound I wish there was more in the bag, especially having two dogs that eat as much as mine do, I end up purchasing a new bag every two weeks to keep up with their meals."
148,"All great, except delivery.  You have to pick it up at the Post Office.  Not again for us..","All great, except delivery.  You have to pick it up at the Post Office.  Not again for us.."
149,Quality nutrition for my picky eater,"Bought this dog food for my Great Dane, she's a very picky eater at times, wouldn't eat her regular dog food she has been on for last 2 years, I put some of this dog food in her bowl and she loved it and cleaned the whole bowl, I was amazed! She has been eating this regularly for about a month now with no problems, I mix a little warm water in it to make a gravy and she loves it. Glad I took a chance and tried it!"
150,Golden retriever loved it.,My dog loved it.  There was no stomach issues. The product seemed as fresh as when I purchase this in the b&m stores. Was delivered quickly.
151,The kibble is HUGE!!!,"I fed my beagle the puppy version of this for a bit until she was almost an adult. I figured I could use this for her and my chihuahua.  But this kibble is so big! Even for a beagle, it is huge. I don't know if it is supposed to be this big because I notice the pics of this food it looks much smaller. I wonder if I got a faulty bag? My dogs don't like it as much either."
152,Great,"Fast delivery, good quality!"
153,Excellent Price for Huge Bag,"I purchased a 35.5 pound bag for my two 15lb dogs. It took them three months to go through it and at the end, they were bored of the flavor. The price for the size though can’t be beat! If it didn’t take so long for them to go through it and if the bags weren’t so huge, I would buy two flavor and switch every month to month and a half."
154,Product never received,Never received product
155,Tasty and wholesome,"I mixed Pro Plan with my dogs more costly Hill’s Science Diet they had become a bit tired of. I selected Pro Plan because I used it years before when it was recommended by my (very expensive) veterinarian - it was his favorite, regardless of cost. The addition of the Pro Plan revived the dog’s interest!"
156,"My dog is a finicky eater, but she'd dug in and acted starve.",Product delivers on it taste my dog loves chicken!
157,Superior Dog Food,"This was recommended by vet as a superior dog food. My cats, who are so picky that they will not eat most expensive cat food, will try to eat this pro food. It cost more, my Golden Retriever is worth it. I also buy Purina Pro Cat Food. So pleased with both products. You get what you pay for."
158,All my animals flock to this food...even the ones not allowed to,"First i think its funny they ask about the taste.  LETS BE CLEAR I DIDNT TASTE IT!  But my dog likes it.  And it must be extra tasty because the cats try and eat it too. And usually they avoid her food.  We transitioned to this food (as of all the positive things i’ve seen), with no problems.  She tolerated well.  No issues.  I should also mention my pup is extremely picky with food.  And she will eat this!  Will continue to buy"
159,Not worth it at all.,Amazon delivers this 35lb. bag to a post office where I have to lug it out to my car and back up to my house.  Absolutely terrible value in my view.
160,My dog thinks the soft pieces are treats,My dog seems happy and content
161,I think Amazon Plus is losing money on me-BUT I LOVE IT. My only negative is the bags that ...,"It is so so handy for me to receive these dog food packages once a month using the Subscribe And Save program.  Not only is the price substantially less than at either of the stores near me, but to have directly delivered to my  storage building is such a plus!  Not only do I not have to wrestle all four or five of the bags (have 6 dogs about 100 pounds each), but it also saves me the 20 mile trip to town as I am in a rural area.  I think Amazon Prime is losing money on me-BUT I LOVE IT.  My only negative is the bags that keep getting smaller--I do remember 50 pound bags, but now we are less than 40...but all the manufacturers are doing that!"
162,"Good food, good price, convenient Subscribe & Save delivery","This has been one of my favorite finds on Amazon. The large bag of food sells for the same price as my local PetSmart or PetCo with the added perks of free delivery and automatic shipments through Subscribe & Save. My two dogs, a boxer mix and a husky mix, have been eating it for over two years and are mostly happy with this food. The boxer is completely happy, but the husky is a picky eater. I used to buy expensive grain free food and she wouldn't touch it at all. She's still picky about this one but she seems to prefer it over the others we've tried. Most of the cheaper foods are made mostly out of corn or grain, while this lists chicken as the first ingredient so I feel ok about feeding it to them."
163,Dogs seem to like it,"So good things are that the dogs like it and the ingredients seem to be on the good side so there is that, price is not the greatest but I am ordering from Amazon and it is getting delivered to my apartment so I expect it to be a little more expensive."
164,Veterinarian (my daughter) approved!,My veterinarian daughter recommended I get this food when I adopted my Rottweiler & I'm glad I did. I have been purchasing it through Prime for 1½ years. The price has gone way up but what hasn't?Great dog food.....
165,Play Sand - Brown,This item is as represented. I can recommend.
166,Very powdery,"Definitely not a favorite. It is very messy due to having an excessive amount of crushed powdered food mixed in and my dog doesn't care for the taste, she spits it out all over the floor."
167,Happy dogs!,We’ve purchased this food in the past and recently came back to it. The dogs seem to live it. I like the size of the kibble and shredded meat. Most importantly the dog is really happy with the change. Time will tell as to the health benefits.
168,Good,"My dog has been on this for quite a while.  She likes the taste, it provides a lot of energy, and it’s very good for her digestion.  What more can you ask from a dog food?"
169,Picky dog approved.,"Our 2 year old dog is very picky and she has been through many types of food- some that cost even more than this, but she gets sick of each food without weeks.I tried wet food, which was easier since my older dog has wet food, but she wouldn't eat even that after a few weeks.... then I tried this dry food and so far so good, she hasn't gotten tired of it yet!I would be careful what size you get though.  I tried to get a big bag and saved money and it took her months to eat... and I think it was getting stale (not sure) but now I only buy the small size since she takes forever to eat it."
170,My animals love it!,"We try to feed our dogs with good quality food. The other brands we were using met with indifference or disgust. We recently had to switch brands as the senior dog got an ulcer and after a few bad changes this is the brand they absolutely love. No more wandering away from a full bowl. When it's chow time they dash to the dishes and devour every delicious morsel! If the dogs aren't careful, even the cat will take a few pieces and greedily consume it.We've noticed no I'll effects from this chow that we've seen from other all natural foods we were trying to get them on. No dry skin, no itching or allergic reactions. Just eager appetites and satisfied stomach's."
171,Great product - 14 y/o dog has NO issues with this food,"My 14 year old mixed breed loves the Pro Plan products,  He was having digestion problems with many other brands --- been using this brand for over a year now -  no more throwing up, no more loose bowls and he eats it quickly.  Feed him twice a day - no range feeding here.  He is 22 - 25 pounds and he gets about 3/4 cup (or less) twice a day.  Do not substitute with other products since he has been using it.  .With in a minute of putting the food in his bowl - he is eating with gusto!It also seems to have regulated his bowels - needing to go out with an hour of eating and no more loose/wet bowels  since he has been on it."
172,Delvery a deal breaker,"The dog food is fine, however I will not be ordering from Amazon because I had to go to post office to get it.  if I had known that I could have just made the drive to PetSmart as it is right in the same location"
173,My rescue loves it!,"I rescued a dog last weekend and I wanted something middle of the range price but not low quality. To my surprise, she gobbled this up the first day I had her (and every day since) and did not have any runny poops. Typically changing a dog's food causes some less than ideal poops, and she wasn't on this food before. I really think this food is great."
174,Recommend by vet. He feeds to his dogs,"Both my dogs love this, especially the tender bits. The minpin will pick them out 1st. The bully pit just eats all of it at once. They don't usually share bowls unless minpin finishes her tender ones & sneaks in the other bowl."
175,Yes BUY IT!,"I break it down to buy it or not.  And I TOTALLY expect a lot from products.  I am a consumer who wants the most for her money....Good stuff! I have had 2 dogs on this food.  One dog I was fostering got adopted, about a month later the new ""parents"" texted me to get the name of this food AGAIN...I had left them with a bag and wrote down the name.  They chose to buy a more expensive brand and the dog wasn't eating.  Look at the ingredience, compare it...or just be happy  I already did it for you and listen to my review,  and know that the ingredients are great! Your dog's digestive tract will be fine..nice on the coat too.  Plus A+ for cost and delivery is easy. Comes in a really strong bag<~~~important."
176,A little pricey,"4 stars for flavor- I haven’t tried it, but the doodle has been eating this for almost 10 years and never complained😋"
177,Great quality ingredients,"A dog food we have been proud to feed our dogs for quite some time. The variety of formulas made it possible to find a flavor they wouldn't tire of, and the ingredients are some we feel good about. Our fur babies deserve it!"
178,My dogs love it!,"This has been hard to find in the store, most pet stores have gone out of business due to COVID. Both my dogs love this food. I have to cut their portions in half and fake them out to make them think they’re getting seconds. Both dogs are seniors and they gobble it right up!"
179,Probiotic works for Dogs,"Dog Food is Great, GOOD LEWELLEN, THIS SELLER IS NOT. BUY FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.I have a Rottie, I have alway fed her the Purina Pro Plan, but i fed her the Sport.  She has trouble getting constipated.  i changed to this Pro Biotic and she has not had any problems since.  so glad i switched."
180,DO NOT BUY,"I don't write reviews, but this deserves it.  Made my dogs deathly sick.  I've only gotten Pro Plan from our local store but decided to purchase on Amazon.  I've never had a problem with my dogs getting sick until I opened this bag, and they were all puking nonstop.  I almost took them to the vet. I've been a dog owner for the last 30 yrs and have never seen anything like it.  I'm out $65 as it is non-refundable product. I wanted to ship it right back.  DO NOT BUY!!!!"
181,High quality food that my dogs love,"My dogs love this food!  I was actually given this in the canned version by my veterinary internist, prior to this I would never have fed my dogs Purina-I thought all Purina was cheap grocery store food.  But this food is wonderful quality, the dogs absolutely love it and their coats are softer & shinier since changing to this food, from grain free over two years ago."
182,Go to Dog Food,"My dog always loves this product. After only buying her Walmart Brand dog food she started eating less, her fur started losing color and her nails began to develop shells. Her Vet told us it was time to switch her to a food that had more nutrients and was a healthier fit for her. She is a 70 lb German Shepard and I couldn’t be happier with the results."
183,Ingredients that are good for your dog.,"Ingredients are good for our dogs, I cannot say if the flavor is good because I haven't eaten it but they have. As for the price , it is not a bad price for something that has good ingredients."
184,What a great driver!,The Prime driver physically brought this huge bag up on my deck! I was so appreciative because I have difficulty lifting it. I wanted to thank him personally. Great employee. 🌺
185,Nutritious for my dogs,My dogs like this food and seem to digest it well. No allergies have been identified and the ages of my dogs are from 1-3.
186,i had to switch brands,"used this years but this year its not agreeing with her. swiched away from purina to a sensitive stomach type, doing better."
187,Dog loves it!,"He's fighting cancer, but he eats this!"
188,Great delivery and in timely fashion,I love the time the product came in. Never had a problem with freshness or the dog food.
189,Great product,It makes me dogs hair very silky and shiny!! My dog isnt crazy about the taste but I purina pro plan wet food to eat and he loves it.
190,Great for senior dog,My lab is 13 years old and on pain meds which causes her stomach problem. Tried several food (name brand and organic to grain free) to offset her stomach being upset and this ended up helping.
191,Expired dog food,The best dog food but it was expired and it’s cheaper at feed stores
192,Dogs love it & they’re all happy & healthy. Can’t complain one bit.,"Despite the fact that I get hassled by some of my well-meaning fellow dog people about using this food, my dogs love it and they have thrived on it for years. I confess I fell for the trend of grain-free, cage-free, gluten-free, organic, limited ingredient, etc foods. My dogs seemed ready to organize a hunger strike. So I switched back permanently &  everyone gets the proplan shredded blend that best suits their dietary needs (puppy, senior, adult, or small breed). And they’re all healthy with great coats, nice teeth, high (so high!) energy. And it’s moderately priced so I don’t have to starve myself to feed my dogs (but I totally would if I had to!)."
193,Like the price can’t go wrong,My dogs love the flavor of the chicken that dried .and I like because it has proboits for there stomach .the price is good for 18 pounds bag .recommend  to have delivered.
194,My Dog loves the crunchy parts,"Canned food is rediculously high priced imo. I have lost so much money buying dry food that my dog refuses to eat. She loves the crunchy bits of this. I thought she would like the soft bits but she didn't even lick one of those. I'm ok with that, I'll leave those out for the wild critters. I'm thrilled that after a year I finally found a dry food my Doodle likes!"
195,My dog loves it.,The ingredients are essential to my dogs health.
196,Try Purina ProPlan if your dog is a picky eater. It's Amazing,"Since I rescued our dog Sheba , a shepherd mix, from the Arkansas Paws in Prison program I have had a horrible time trying to find something that Sheba would eat besides table food.  It's almost been a year and tried many dog foods but never the Purina Pro Plan blend til now.  I just recieved a few minutes ago opened it and filled Sheba's bowl.  OMG she devoured it like she was starving to death and I had just fed her a can of Alpo earlier this morning which she reluctantly ate but this was about the only thing I could get her to eat in the way of dog food, that is, until the ProPlan.  It's amazing and I can hardly believe it.  Sold Sold Sold"
197,Dog isn’t eating it all,Hi I’m just trying to get in contact with someone.I noticed towards the middle of the bag some pieces were like crumbles. I really started noticing it when my dog was only eating those pieces. There’s not many of those and she is now refusing to eat the triangle pieces and having to throw the rest out.She’s been getting sick lately as well.I’m hoping to get some answers.I will take down I just was trying to get ahold of someone so please reply
198,Great food,This dog food was recommended for my 10 year old pit bull. Ever since we started using this food my dog hasn’t had any stomach issues.
199,Purina pro plan probiotics,"I am a veterinary technician and I LOVE THIS FOOD! My dogs love it and one is super picky. I love the pre and probiotics. Reduces stomach gurgles, GAS, and over all reduce booting in his abdomen."
200,DELIVERY,"I love this dog food , BUT they leave it at my mailbox rather than bringing to the house...it's a 47# bag.  I would appreciate it being put on my front porch"
201,Let Prime Deliver To Your Door!,"I have a 4 year old pudelpointer and a 6 year old cockapoo and we use Prime to deliver this huge bag of food to our door each month. First, the price is directly competitive with a box store and, second, I don't have to carry the heavy awkward back a half mile across a parking lot and back home. The food itself is great quality, we have never had any issues and the dogs both love it. My pudelpointer is an active hunter and he will scarf this down and keep right on running. We will stick with this as long as Purina keeps making it!"
202,Something changed. Was great,Why did the color of the food get darker? Also the shredded chicken pieces got smaller and less soft. My dog used to dig those out first as soon as i filled the bowl. Now she barely goes after a few pieces
203,Bad Batch,"I'd been feeding this to my dog for over a year and he enjoyed it until last March 2022. When I open this latest bag, I noticed that some of the chicken chicken looked a smaller, so I just figured the processing was just cutting them smaller similar to what we are seeing in all consumer products now (increased price with smaller portions). My dog threw up 4 times within 5 minutes of completing his breakfast.  I assumed he just ate too fast.  However he three up the same at dinner.  I tried a couple things including cutting portion size,  slowing down eatting process, removing chicken chunks, etc,.  No improvement.  Looked at AMAZON reviews to see if anyone else had experienced this besides me.  Wow.  Had to go to the Pet store to buy off the shelf."
204,Seems like good dog food,Dog food is loved by my boys shipping is highly disliked my me 😁  PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS SHIPPED USPS AND EVERY TIME THEY CLAIM ATTEMPTED DELIVERY AND SAY I HAVE TO PICK IT UP FROM USPS.. MY OFFICE FACES THE DOOR..  THEY NEVER ATTEMPT DELIVERY! I have no idea how fresh or what the flavor is but my dogs like it.  The scheduled delivery timing just doesn't work for us.
205,My dog's favorite!,"Don't know what they put in this stuff but this is my dog's favorite food. We have been rotating bags every time she finishes them, one after the other, for two years. This is the only food she goes head down into her bowl for, and licks the bowl when it's empty. Why this is significant: my dog is the least food-motivated dog I've ever known. She has no interest in food. It is not unusual for her to go 24-36 hours without eating. This food changed that pattern! She LOVES it!"
206,Dogs and the Cat Love it!,"I have a Boston pit, golden doodle and a cat who all love this dog food!  My cat is 16 years old and refuses to eat cat food after stealing Purina Pro Plan from the dogs!"
207,Vet Recommended and dog approved!,My boxador was pretty picky when it came down to trying different types of dog food. We tried several types with the same results. Any unhappy dog. I asked my sister who is a veterinarian and she highly recommended this brand food. The price is a little higher however think about the food you eat. Would you want to eat a cheap hamburger or would you pay slightly more for a better steak? The food doesn't have a terrible smell or look. My dog absolutely loves it.  There is no need to pay the big bucks for the brands you always see advertised. They are well known only because they put money out to advertise.  With Purina pro plan you will get exactly what you pay for..Quality!
208,All dogs that come to my house live it,My dogs love it
209,It's great healthy food!,"It's the best dog food out there!! I've raised 4 dogs on this food with no skin issues, no potty issues, no coat issues and no weight issues. I highly recommend this product."
210,My Dogs Love It,"One of my dogs was a very picky eater who had been on a prescription diet for most of his life. When he was cleared for regular food at last, I went through many varieties, hoping to find one he would actually eat, including some very expensive specialty foods. After a day or two he would turn up his nose at them, until I found ProPlan, which he clearly loved, as did my two hounds (although with basset hounds, it is unusual to find any food they don't enjoy!)I was very happy to find I could buy it for monthly delivery, rather than having to schlepp to the store every couple of weeks for a new bag! My vet, who always asks what I am feeding my pets, told me she approved of ProPlan, as well, which made me feel good about feeding it."
211,Would buy again,Would buy again!
212,Good quality,My fur babies have done very well with this food.Highly recommend!
213,... the Iams I had been using and my dogs loved it. I have a giant dog and a ...,I got this when Amazon was out of the Iams I had been using and my dogs loved it.  I have a giant dog and a petite dog and both really seem to like the food.  I have seen no evidence of waste as you would see using a cheap food with a giant dog.  I highly recommend it.Absolutely no evidence of any bug infestations as I have read in some reviews.Update.  After another price increase I have gone back to Iams.  My dogs never had any problems with the Pro Plan but it now costs about $15 more than Iams and my dogs eat the Iams just fine.
214,"Yummy for Four Tummies, one ""sensitive""","Taste of Wild or Purina ProPlan Chicken are Both are equally loved by 2 female chihuahuas, male dachshund, and the chi-weenie baby of the younger chi and dachshund.  I find a slight pref for this one among all 4.  We even get a bit if growling between the 2 chi females when dinner is served. My male has a sensitive stomach which has 3 pancreatic flare ups and a few grand in overnight vet stays and tolerates this and tow wonderfully.  I'm recording our 3rd 35lb bag so everyone loves it.  Funny aside..there are some larger morsels that must taste better than the others b/c the 2 female chi eat around the bowl and pick these out first."
215,We had been shopping around for a dog food that would be good for them and that they liked,"We bought this dog food for our two medium sized dogs. We had been shopping around for a dog food that would be good for them and that they liked. We also needed a big enough bag that it would last them. We bought the biggest bag that they have, and we also made it a subscription so that it comes every month! We feed them twice a day, and the bag lasts the month. We have never had any issues with the food or delivery! Our boys seem to like it a lot. They will be outside, and they'll hear us fill their bowl and be waiting by the door. They gobble it down quick, that's for sure!"
216,My dog loves Purina Pro Plan,Subscribing to have Purina Pro Plan delivered each month works out great. You get a slight discount and it’s right at my door. The product is good and my dog loves it.
217,Quality product,"I have 2 fairly large dogs and have this product delivered on a subscription.  This is the first time that when my husband opened the box and lifted out the bag, dog food fell out because there was a hole on the bottom of the bag.  My husband had to clean up the floor from the mess.  I was quite surprised since this has never happened before ."
218,Great!,My dog loves it!
219,My dog approves.,My labradoodle is picky eater but seems to like this food pretty well.  It has hard kibble and also morsels of dried chicken bits.  His vet recommended this brand and he eats it.  Win-win.
220,I no longer have a dog.,I cancelled the subscription to the food because I no longer have a dog.  The food was fine.
221,Good dog food.,My dogs coat is fantastic.  Veterinarian recommends.  Dog always eats and is in good health.
222,Great product,Read the ingredients then you automatically know it is good for your pets
223,Great dog food!,"My vet recommended this after trying every healthy and special dog food out there. Our dog kept has loose stools and other issues, and about 2 weeks on this food, his stools were already better. He’s been on this food for about 2 years now and he loves it!"
224,Made dogs sick!!!,I am not sure what’s going on but the color of this food this time around has changed and it definitely has less chicken. Not sure if I got a bad batch but 2 out of my 3 dogs are sick from eating this food for just one week!!!!
225,Good food for dogs,Giving the flavor a high mark was really just a guess overall. My dogs of different sizes are very happy with the flavor it seems like. It was an easy transition from their previous food and I haven’t seen any stomach issues.
226,Long-time customer! Very pleased!,"We have been feeding this food to our dogs for about 10 years. It was recommended by our vet when we found out our lab couldn't tolerate beef.  All of our dogs seem to enjoy this food. We have several different breeds of dogs, including a husky and a terrier mix, so it's versatile between the different breeds and sizes.  It has two textures. One is the traditional harder pellets and the other is a more natural shaped (slightly softer) piece.  Our cat would eat this if we let him!"
227,Happy Puppy!,"My dog is food-crazy and she loves this product. It keeps her tummy happy, which makes me happy too. No gas, no bloating, she's even lost some weight and is a healthy, lean, happy puppy. She's coming up on 3 years old and I will continue to purchase this dog food! I like that the pieces look like real food, and not just kibbles. Stays fresh and is always packaged well."
228,DON'T BUY,This was an Amazon's Choice product and it made my puppy terribly sick. We were about to bring her to the vet which would have cost a fortune in tests to figure out what was wrong. She was having to get up every hour in the night with diarrhea and was vomiting too.
229,My dog loves this food,"My dog has been eating only this food for the entire time we've had her, which is almost three years. She loves it, never has a problem eating it, and she is very healthy. It is also a good value."
230,Greyhounds like it.,"We have picky greyhounds so we are constantly searching for a food they will eat.  They love this food.  It was recommended by someone in an online greyhound group, so we tried it.  We have 3 greyhounds and they cleaned their bowls the first night.  They don’t always eat it at breakfast time but they have been consistently eating it for dinner.  The food is larger kibble and more than one shape."
231,A Great Dane. Bichon and Malti-Poodle love this food.,"My 3 dogs love this food.  I used to buy Purina One, Lamb with Rice from the grocery store.  My Great Dane did well on in, but my Bichon would only eat the dark morsels, leaving the light ones all over the floor. When I switched to the Chicken Pro Plan Food, I figured there might be some problems with the change.  To my surprise, the only difference is that my Bichon eats both the light and dark pieces, and I don't have to sweep the floor every day.I free-feed this food to a 10-year=old Great Dane, a 10-year=old  Bichon Frieze and a 2-year-old small Malti-Poodle. They are all indoor dogs, get no table food, and all have great teeth and breath as a result.."
232,Tasty Food My Dog Loves and Her Itching Has Decreased Significantly,"My dog loves this food. She’s been eating it for several months now. She is very happy with the combination of soft and crunchy textures. Of note, her itching has diminished drastically since on this food even though it’s not grain free. I don’t think it’s a coincidence. She’s has had a major itching problem for several years due to seasonal allergies (although she is affected year round as we live in the south) that has required prescription medication and she barely scratches now. Is it the new food? I’m not 100% sure but I will definitely keep feeding her this."
233,My Aussie loves this combo of crunchy and softer pieces together!,"I have a 4 year old, fussy mini Aussie, and she really loves this food. The combination of the crunchies with the shredded softer chicken pieces are just perfect for her. She now eats her whole meal at once, instead of picking all day, and not enjoying her food/flavor."
234,On time good product,On time and good product. Didn’t eat it myself but dogs appear to enjoy it.
235,It’s good for my Lab.,"It seems to have quite a bit of fine bits in there, otherwise my dog really loved it!"
236,Good dog food and value,"A couple of our dogs are sensitive to just about every ingredient in most dog foods.  So we've tried a lot of brands and flavors.  So far this one seems like it has been the easiest on our dogs' stomachs and they really like it.  And it is considerably cheaper than most brands we've been through.  That's a good thing, since 3 of them are over 65 pounds.  My only negative would be that the food ships in an enormous box.  They could easily shop it in a box half the size."
237,Not sure about the flavor but there you go everything else was fine LOL,I would say it was a Purina standard quality anymore it's hard to tell a lot about the extra ingredients unless you are a chemistry majorBut overall a normal Healthy dog should thrive on this Pro Plan
238,Five Stars! Very convenient!,"I can’t speak to the nutritional quality of the dog food (because I am certainly no expert). However, my dogs eat it, and I have *heard* that vets recommended this dog food to some of my friends. You really can’t beat the convenience factor, though. It is so much easier when these big bags of dog food are delivered to your front door in such a quick manner than having to go to the store yourself! The price point is great, too!"
239,Next time ask your dog what they like to eat,Whether it’s Me or my dogs but when we bought this product which is an upgrade from what they’ve been eating they won’t even touch it
240,Problems with multiple dogs vomiting once we started getting Pro Plan from Amazon. *Updated,"*Tried two more bags from Amazon, and so far haven't had the vomiting problems. However, I'm lowering my rating to one star,potentially for something out of Purinas control, but it needs to be said.I paid $29.99 per bag just a couple months ago, today it's $39.99 per bag (and I need two). Are you kidding me? This isn't sustainable for me, so I'm off to Walmart.----------------------------------I have three dogs - two 50 pounders, and a little 15 pounder. We have used Pro Plan for years, buying it from PetSmart. I got fed up with PetSmart constantly being out of it, so I checked out Pure Balance from Walmart and found it to have comparable if not better ingredients. HOWEVER, Walmart kept running out of it(!).Got more fed up with brick and mortar retailers, so I reluctantly tried Amazon for Pro Plan. Price can wildly fluctuate, but it's still the same or lower (usually) than PetSmart. And always in stock.The problem - two dogs starting vomiting. $300 worth of vet bills later, nothing was found. They got better. Now the third one is vomiting, and the other two sporadically have issues. The only common denominator is Amazon's Pro Plan food. I can't imagine Amazon gets their supply from anyone different than PetSmart, but who knows. It's not expired, the bags look fine, but it just seems too coincidental that all of the dogs (historically very healthy) start vomiting all around the same time.It's the internet, so take my feedback with a grain of salt, but I think I'm going to go back to Pure Balance from Walmart. Cheaper, and I'll just need to stock up a little better."
241,Dogs love it,Great value
242,"Formula changed a few months ago, my dogs got sick and stopped eating, my golden retriever died","My dogs have been on this food for almost 4 years. I thought about 4 months ago that only the bag design had changed and could not find anything on the formula having changed. When I opened a new bag about a 2 and 1/2 months or so ago, my dogs started vomiting after eating, then wouldn't touch the food at all. I thought it was their vitamins since I had opened a new package of that also. Then one dog (golden retriever) started leaving food in her bowl which she has never done in 10 years!! Then when both dogs stopped eating completely, I began researching and found hundreds of FB posts  (on the Purina page) and Reddit posts about other peoples dogs getting sick! This was a good brand until they changed the formula. Although I changed the food, it was too late for my golden retriever and she ended up with kidney failure within a month after I fed her that food and ended up dying last month. Since I don't have definitive proof it was the food, I can't really blame them, but I am highly suspicious since both dogs got sick at the same exact time and stayed sick until I got them onto different food."
243,My dog really likes it and it’s a good quality dog food,My 1 yr old dog just switched from puppy food to adult dog food. We tried other brands that she didn’t care for but really likes this one
244,Wrong food in bag,"The bag was labeled shredded, but it is not the shredded food. It is mislabeled. My dog won't eat it, but when she tries, she throws it up. I would appreciate another bag of the shredded food and hopefully it is correctly labeled."
245,Good food!,My dog has done really well with this food! I’ve tried many brands but she loves this one. I’ll keep buying it!
246,Something changed badly,"My 4 dogs have been on this for years. We struggled with supply issue during covid and now that it's back readily available- 2 of my 4 dogs are sick from it. They're puking, having stomach issues and are insanely itchy. I always supported this dog food but I can't after whatever they changed recently."
247,Quality product,My breeder actually recommended this food and my dog loves it.
248,My dog loved it!,My dog loved this food. She ate it and had no issues switching from puppy food to adult food.
249,which is a lot better than the stuff he used to get,"My boy loves this food, which is a lot better than the stuff he used to get.  You can see the chunks of chicken right in the food and I can see when he goes right after them first thing.  The quantity of the chicken pieces seems to be pretty good too.Can't say I've noticed any more energy or a better coat or anything after a few months being on this food, but I can tell her enjoys meal time more than he used to."
