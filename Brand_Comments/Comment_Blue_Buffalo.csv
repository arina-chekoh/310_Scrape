0,My dogs love it - but currently out of stock,"Yes and yes! Both my border collie and Chihuahua mix love it! Only that now it’s out of stock and I have to switch to the chicken flavor- I prefer to choose fish because intuitively speaking it would provide more omega acid which should be beneficial to their health… but don’t have detailed stats or hard evidence for that. I have already purchased the yellow chicken bag, will update whether they like that flavor."
1,I've not had problems with this food,"I've had no problems with this brand of BB dog food.  I just started shipments 2 months ago.  After reading the 1 star comments I was concerned, but giving issues a thought it could be from over heating if delivered in summer.  Dogfood maybe dry but there is moisture in it to an extent.  If it goes from cool to hot moisture can occur (even with the dog food in the stores).  I will certainly keep an eye on my dogs delivered food.  But, I am not going to stop my shipments unless it is during a very HOT stretch of summer then I may pause shipments for those months.  I do have to say BB is very good dog food.  I own 7 Miniature Australian Shepherds and 1 toy Dachshund. 1 Aussie has some food allergies that dissappear with this food."
2,Inconsistent quality,"My dog has been eating this dog food for 10 years now. I have noticed that when I order it from Amazon the bags contents are very different from one to the other. Color, size, smell and sometimes the points cards are missing which makes me think the bags are very old. This last order the pieces were smaller and smelled better. Previous order they were bigger and lighter in color. When it comes to amazon I'm always worried about dupes and when it comes to consumables that can be dangerous."
3,My dog loves it!,"My dogs have been eating this a few years now and they love it. One of my dogs has pancreatitis and he was on prescription dog food for awhile, but it was insanely expensive. When I found this dog food, we tried it out and have had no issues at all."
4,My dogs love this and they eat it all,My dogs eat anything but I noticed they take their time with some food eating it or don’t eat it at all but with this they eat it all and even have more energy
5,Nutritious and apparently tastes good,We feed blue buffalo products to our Heeler and our lab/Pitt mix.
6,Best dog food,Love the convenience of having it delivered to my door. Best dog food for my pugs. Fast delivery
7,Size,Smaller than I expected for the price. Better deal at Sam’s
8,Good  Food,"Most dogs take some time to adjust to new food, but I mixed this in with his previous dry food for a while, and he was soon ready to eat this on its own. He likes it in addition to the cooked turkey or chicken I put on top for meals. This is more nutritious than his previous dry food, so I’m happy."
9,Great Food,I have 3 shiatzu's and they love this food and the fish flavor. It has helped my oldest with his digestive problems. Highly recommend
10,Good quality,Dog loves it
11,Most important— my dog likes it,Comes in small pieces which is important for a small dog
12,Great for picky dog eaters.,"my dog is a picky eater. will avoid kibble for days until shes starved enough to stomach it. Have tried many brands. Shell eat this without much hassle. She still isnt the biggest fan, only eats about 2/3 of her meal.This also smells the best from all the other kibbles we've had. theres a strong smell of soysauce on it. I think that helps."
13,My dogs love it,"My dogs get tired of their food regularly but this, they love"
14,The only food my dog eats,My dog has been eating this for the last year. It isn't the best overall dry food but is far from the worst. It is a good quality choice.
15,My dog loves it,My dog loves this product. Will return if this turns out to be a healthy choice for him.
16,"Its great for your dog, and no waste.","My dog likes the taste, and is staying heathy and lean."
17,Great Product,My dogs love this product. They seem to have more energy. Not weighed down with all the additives.
18,The dogs balked at the previous dry food. They eat this kind.,"I used to think all dogs were always hungry and would always eat. My current pack is nothing like that. I switch around with both wet and dry dog food, as well as whether the pack gets dry in the morning, wet for dinner, or vice versa, sometimes the same thing both times. And snacks. Lots of snacks. I try to keep them from getting bored while also developing a familiarity, two obviously contradictory goals. They generally stop eating any kind of dry food I've given them, from Purina to Nutra Nugget, after a while. This one, Blue Buffalo, they'll still turn up their nose to, if they can weasel their way into getting me to make them burgers or salmon or chicken (their favorite.) Instead of picking through their bowls for the meat and leaving the dry food to sit until later (just before bed), they'll eat this too. I don't have high expectations, so having them eat what I give them, when I give it to them, counts as a win for me."
19,Our dogs love it,Our boxer and mixed German Sheppard love the food and haven't had any issues. We will continue to order.
20,Exactly what I wanted!!,"Great healthy dog food, normal price point, fast delivery!"
21,Great quality,Fast shipping and great quality as always
22,Quality food,Price was high but quality is good
23,My dogs seem to love it,"My Rottie was having skin issues, since I’ve put him on Blue Buffalo, the problem has cleared! I honestly think it was something in the other dog foods he was allergic to."
24,Dog loves the flavor.,"I was looking for a new dog food for my dog. Came across this, and she loves it"
25,7 Dogs love it,My dogs love the flavor and texture.  Also good for their teeth
26,dog loves this food her coat is a lot softer,she loves this food and her energy is a little more than before. Thanks for being on prime!!
27,Great Product and very good price.,"Search a lot of other foods and for the size and quality, this is the one I need for my dog."
28,my dog loves this food,This is very high quality dog food that my dog loves.
29,Happy with this for my dog,We're happy with this dog food. My dog seems to like it.
30,Good product.WAY OVERPRICED,"Too costly. I like the product for my pets, but it can't be returned so try to find a local vendor."
31,No more scratching,"We have at least one dog that is allergic to poultry.  This is far cheaper than buying  it at Publix, plus the dogs are no longer scratching and in misery.  So much easier to have it delivered than for my disabled son to try and hoist it out of the trunk once we are home."
32,Not suitable for picky eaters,"My dogs typically aren’t picky and they were very finicky with this food. They barely at any of it. I decided to order another flavor. Hopefully they like the beef flavor. HOWEVER, my cat would not stay away from this dog food. We had to pick up the bowls so he would not eat it."
33,Nice small easily digested nuggets.,Dog ate this first time I  fed  her this  new dogfood. Also enjoyed when mixed with canned food.
34,Blue Buffalo Dry Dog Food,My two large dogs have always done well with BB dog food. They've been eating it since they were pups. I received a big bag of dry Lamb & rice food rvery 2 weeks. The food has always been good quality with high protein & low fat.I recommend.
35,My dogs love this,"I was looking for something healthier to feed my dogs and they seem to love this.  My only complaint is the price, I wish it were cheaper."
36,Blue buffalo food,This is the only food we use for our fur babies.
37,Better ingredients than prior dog food,"One of our dogs has allergies and weight issues.  So far, this food is helping.  We want to get him to a healthy weight, but also not make his skin allergies worse."
38,good stuff,;good stuff
39,Dogs have been sick for a week,"I agree with another reviewer. My 2 dogs have been eaten this food for a long time. However, during the past week and a half, both have been showing signs of not feeling well. I suspected the food. Then last night, one of the dogs had a major attack of diarhea on the kitchen floor (yeah, smart dog). I'm going to toss mine too and head over to the local source. It might be the heat causing the food to go bad. I just thought others should know about this too."
40,Will stick with B. B.,Tried the Amazon brand food bc I am cheap. It really messed with my dog's gut. They all were gassy and stinky. Bought Blue Buffalo afterwards and hoped the splurge would fix the problem. It did! I am so glad. I won't stray again.
41,great for picky dogs (at least for both of mine),"This food works great for both my dogs. I will write out a description of their dog food history and health history to see if this food works for you!First dog, 4 years old german shepherd mix rescue:- she has many allergies (but no food allergies) and this is one of the only foods that does not make her itch- her ""business"" is always regular and she never direaha (she used to on Kirkland food)- her coat is healthy- affordable for the ingredients / quality- she is very picky for other foods (wont accept it as treat, will only eat once a day), but with this, she is always hungry for itSecond dog, 1 year old corgi:- used to buy Arcana for him thinking that he would love it, but he got tired of it and I switched him to her food. He loves this food so much more.- his ""business"" is always regular- no issues at all since he switched to this foodoverall, i would say try it out to see if your pet likes it! both of mine love it"
42,"Dog loves it, shipping frequently a mess!","The dog loves it, he’s an English Bulldog and their tummy’s can be sensitive but this works for him.  The issue is USPS delivers this package (for some reason) and it arrives damaged on a regular basis.  Frequently (more then 3 times or I wouldn’t bother writing this) the box is broken, ripped, and damaged.  Amazon customer service responds quickly to remedy the issue.  However, it’s easily fixed with just some attention to detail on the Post Office delivery people."
43,Power to change!,"Bears had just fought 2 cancers and was in horrible shape I decided to switch to this when he got CHUSINGS DIEASE dianagosis right 2 months after his last cancer surgery. His skin was in terrible shape, he was getting cysts, clogged pores, major hair loss especially. And oh! The weight gain..in five months he put on almost 15 pnds topping off at 123, he's normally around 103-108. After just 3 months it's really incredible he's long beautiful coat is coming back in that I loved so much, he's energetic agin and down 15 pounds ..moving to 5 acres helped and praise all that's holy no more nasty cysts! I'm so happy to say their is a DOG FOOD that's NUTRITIOUS AND GOOD for OUR DOGS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM..Iam paying about 18 dollars  more each month but to keep my best friend by my side is so WORTH IT!"
44,My dog is sick,"My dog is 12 years old and he has been on blue buffalo for 11 years. I have the chicken and rice on subscription for years. The bag I received on Oct 12 I started feeding my dog about a week later and he started getting diarrhea and upset stomach, I cooked him food for a week and after slowly reintroducing him back to this food (wasn’t sure it was the food that caused it) he was sick again."
45,The taste and quanity.pitbull,Everything was great.
46,My dog loves it,We ended up with a subscription for it because our little dog loves it and it's so convenient!
47,good quality food for the pet,"My dog eats a different brand. however, it was not available. when I put it in the dog bowl he gobbled it up and wanted more. So I guess it tastes good. He loves it"
48,Best dog food,"I've been feeding this to my dogs for many years, so I thought I'd finally write a review.  This is the only dog food I've found that every dog I've ever had loves to eat.  I prefer feeding my dogs food with good ingredients, and this fits the bill.  Is it expensive?  Yep, but my guys are worth it."
49,Great,My dog loves this food.  She seems healthier and happier than when I was giving her another brand
50,Dog is happy,Have been using Blue Buffalo for years now. We have one of the laziest dog so this formula is perfect for a dog that refuses to move.
51,Moldy batch,Beware - I’ve been ordering from here for heard (i have the subscription) and we opened our new bag today and it was moldy and wet. :( Had to run to the store to get a replacement so my pups could eat.
52,Great product,My dog loves it
53,Easy on pets stomachs,My boxers have very sensitive tummys and Blue Buffalo keeps then feeling like champs.
54,Ace is my grand pup and he love is Blue Buffalo,Ace is my grand pup and he love is Blue Buffalo
55,Dogs Ate It BUT..,Our dogs left the little round pieces all over the floor. They loved the bigger pieces so I think the rice is the little round balls and our two picky eaters want only the meat. Other two dogs ate it all and cleaned up after the two picky eaters.
56,"Great, but our two wire haired fox terriers prefer the Blue Jolly Joints.","Great, but our two wire haired fox terriers prefer the Blue Jolly Joints."
57,River doesn't like the round pieces.,"My dog is NOT a picky eater, but she leaves the little round pieces all around her bowl.  I'm not sure what makes them different than the larger pieces but she won't eat them!I'm wasting half of the dog food.  I won't buy it again.I do think it's funny that she can spit the round ones out of her mouth.  I've never seen her do that before.I will be sticking with Solid Gold."
58,Packaging for the bags rips easily,"Ripped packaging, which means it could have been sitting on a shelf for quite a while with a rip before arriving here for the dog. Makes you question the freshness or safety of the food. Had to refund. 3 stars because i got a refund, otherwise it would be 1 star"
59,My Dog eats it,"Dog food, dogs eat it and don't starve"
60,Good stuff,Good stuff
61,Why the exceptionally large / unaffordable price increase?,"I needed to purchase a high quality, healthy, weight maintenance dog food for our * year old Lab mix Daisy. She has ballooned to 116 pounds in June since I am no longer able to take her for long walks. With the weight gain she has become lethargic, sleeping all hours even during the day and has become uninterested in playing with any of her toys. In addition to her not getting enough exercise she is acting very depressed and I can relate it to first the loss of mybeloved Australian Sheppard ""Dito"" 6 months ago and 2 weeks later the death of my wonderful husband in May from COVID.  We all need to exercise and eat our way back to health. I talked to my vet and did my own research and found the Blue Buffalo Healthy Weight Life protection formula. The cost was out of my reach in our local grocery store so I checked here on Amazon. On August 1st I bought a 30 lb bag of the chicken and brown rice formula for $35.53. Daisy did not complain at all as I started to mix it gradually into her food. Feeding her 2 cups twice daily she started to lose weight without begging for scraps or treats so I assume she was satisfied. A visit in September to the vet had a weigh in of 101 pounds. Amazing. She was able to jump up on the bed, looking to play tug with her giant rope and had a little spirit again. The vet wants her at 80 pounds so we intend to keep her on this food. Due to the mixing with daisy's old food for the first 14 day, that bag lasted 7 weeks. I purchased another 30 lb bag on September 20 for $34.26. I was checking prices on Prime Day for many of the deals and decided to buy another bag before I ran out and was shocked to find the price ""Starting at $54.88"" for the same 30 lb bag and not available as prime. That is a $20.00 increase!! Why?? I will find it very difficult to spend that much and I do not want to switch her food when she is doing so well now. I hope this increase is temporary...please."
62,My dog enjoyed this,Thor really liked this food and gobbled it up at his mealtime!
63,Dogs are happy!,Good product dogs are very healthy
64,Great size for 30 pound dogs and under.,The small adult bites helps my small dog chew through them. She likes to mow through her food so I had worries of her chocking or getting sick from the fast consumption. These small bites are just enough for her and I'm less worried for her chocking :)
65,Great Food For My Loving Pet,Love the value and price. Within my budget.
66,My dog loves it!,"While I couldn’t bring myself to taste test it, my dog has and absolutely loves it. It seems to be his favorite dry food and has a good mix of higher quality ingredients.My dog gives it two paws up!"
67,Met Satisfaction,Used with mix dog has been used to.  She slightly prefers the older but eats both.  Am ordering more.
68,great value,great value
69,my dogs loved,i like the facts is not belly issues with my dogsi use this product for almost 15 years or more i have chow chow breeds for all this time and this is the best for the money.totally worthedrudystay strong
70,Puppy liked it,Good size lasted about 3 months
71,My dogs love the food,My dogs live the food and they are healthy.
72,Like the 38pd size!!!,My standard poodle loves her food!!!!
73,Dogs love it,My dog was throwing up and having tummy issues before so i decided to take the plunge financially and try Blue and my dog has had no more issues!!!! They love it! I would have given it 5 stars but this bag came very crushed with a lot of powder instead of the bits.They send reward points in the bag and those are fun to get and use to get free things for the pups!!
74,Dog is happy,"My dog gets lots of energy from this food. The only thing I don’t like about this dog food is the bag it comes in. No matter from where I order this product, the bag ends up being busted in the box, with food spilling out. The quality of the bag - isn’t strong enough to carry the weight."
75,Dogs love it,Great food
76,Best Dog Food!,"I had my 10lb chihuahua on Hills Science Diet Lamb and Rice and a vitamin supplement. She would not eat all her food or even not at all. Her coat would be drab and she itched all the time from dry skin even after adding vitamin supplements. I decided to try Blue Buffalo Chicken and Rice. Not only was it the same cost as I was paying for Hills it weighed a pound more. My dog absolutely loves it. Plus, I do not have to give her whole cup of food and baked chicken to fill her up when she would even eat the dry food. She always managed to eat the baked chicken though.I now give her the recommended amount of 1/4-1cup. I give her 1/4 dry and mix some baked chicken with the Blue Buffalo and she eats all of it up all of the time. No left overs. Her coat and skin is not as dry like before and I was able to stop adding vitamin supplements saving me money. My dog was transformed within 3 weeks to 1 month. I highly recommend this product."
77,My dog loves it,My dog has been eating it for a few years now
78,My dog LOVES it!,My dog absolutely loves this product and flavor! It's worth the money. And that big bag will last me about a month and a half!
79,He eats it and loves it!,To feed my dog?!
80,Not my dog's favorite,"I usually buy the chicken flavor but saw the beef and thought ""hey, why not"". Well, Nina Simone Biles did not appreciate the switch and ate it very sparingly. Eventually I bought a bag of the chicken flavor and mixed the two flavors together."
81,Amazing!,"I have a GSD and he used to shed like crazy. Since changing To this food, his skin is better and his shedding has decreased substantially. I also love that Amazon ships this for me on a regular schedule without me having to go in and purchase it every time. You can also change the frequency in which it’s sent. Life changing on both parts."
82,All of my pets are fed Blue Buffalo,I like the quality but the prices are getting too high.
83,Great product,Dogs eat all of it...no waste.
84,Great buy,My dog love it
85,My dog could not wait for me to get the bag open!,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, my dog could not wait for me to get the bag open & pour him a bowl! I hope it’s as good for him as they say."
86,Dog food,I have been buying it once a month for over 4 year's.Yes my dog likes it and it meets our needs.Do you really need to ask me every month for a review?
87,Dogs Enjoyed This!,The dogs seemed to enjoy this more than their regular brand. It's more expensive so I will purchase when I can but it seems worth the price.
88,Nutritional information,"I've never been able to afford Blue for my babies. But my circumstances have changed and I have tried Blue and they love it. In only a week I can see an improvement in their vitality and overall health.  This ain't no commercial,  but I'll never switch again. Even if I have to go without!"
89,Great product,"This product is the ""bumper diggidy"" . My pet loves it ."
90,Flawless transition from previous food.,My 5 year old pup didn't blink an eye at the change. She gobbles it right down and has maintained healthy bowel habits.
91,Best for our dog,It the best food for our dog the ingredients our great also it he likes it
92,Blue Buffalo is our favorite,My pup really enjoys this brand. It doesn’t harm her tummy and she has not had any bouts of tummy irritation since we began feeding her it.
93,Great product,"Claire, my Italian Greyhound loves this food and if she could eat the entire bag she would"
94,Buffalo for the win,I started my lab on Buffalo back when he started having digestive issues. And have never switched and never will. Their health = my happiness 😀
95,Delicious for my dog,"My dog loves it!  She gobbles it down so fast, I figured it must be some good food."
96,Dogs enjoy!,We had to switch from Iams due to Iams causing one of the dogs to be excessively gassy.  Blue Buffalo seems to be more gentle on their stomach.  Vet recommended this brand.  So far so good.  We do have it set up on automatic shipment which is a nice convenience.
97,Nutrition,My dogs love it and it is healthy for them.  Keeps their bowels regular
98,"Can't Vouch for the Flavor, Tippy Don't Talk!  But What's with the ""Healthy HOLISTIC"" Label??? !","To know how this tastes, we'd need a talking dog.Will someone esplaine the ""Healthy and HOLISTIC"" printing on the top front of the bag?I looked, but couldn't find any holes.  Looks like it was translated in a far off place.Surprising, for pet food that wasn't purchased because it was inexpensive..."
99,Helped eliminate Aussie's skin issues!,"Our 7 year old Australian Shepherd was having very severe skin issues.  Our vet couldn't find the cause and suggested to switch foods.  We'd been feeding Merrick & Merrick's cheaper brand Whole Earth Farms for years, never thinking it was the food since his potty time was always fine & other than the skin issues he was in great health.  Being so sick & tired of his poor skin problems I gave Blue Buffalo a shot & I gave it several bags before I made a decision as to if it was helping at all or doing nothing.  I figured the food would probably have nothing to do with any of the skin issues and was just taking a shot in the dark picking Blue Buffalo.  I was absolutely shocked that his skin issues are totally 100% gone now - all cleared up & 100% healed!  Now I do want to be super clear here & state that I honestly believe it was the removal of his old food that was what caused this amazing improvement, not the addition of Blue Buffalo.  Hope that makes sense!I mean that, I think any other good quality food would have very likely caused improvement in his skin issues.  I just happened to choose Blue Buffalo & it just happened to work great for us!  It's good quality nutrition, our Aussie seems to like the taste, it's always available here on Amazon & if for some reason I don't want the Chicken & Rice at any point there are plenty other varieties to choose from.  I really love when pet food companies have various kinds & flavors so we can keep our dog's digestive system regular & give him some variety to keep him excited about food!  We can switch between any of the varieties without any fuss because most of them have very similar ingredients. The biggest positive I can report is, we didn't transition him at all from his old food to Blue Buffalo.  So we were expecting some not-so-great potty results.  Nope!  All went smooth & no changes in his digestive system!  We have ALWAYS had major trouble if we didn't switch him slowly, so I was really surprised nothing happened negatively & his food transition went as easy as pie!  I personally as of now highly recommend Blue Buffalo!"
100,Dog food rocks. Shipping sucks.,Our dogs love blue diamond. We’ve tried different brands and always come back to this. I wish they didn’t use USPS to ship. They won’t ship oversized packages and you have to go to the USPS office to pick it up. Defeats the whole purpose of Amazon!!
101,"I like the food, sadly, my dog doesn't :(","I read a lot about this food prior to making my purchase. My dog recently suffered from life-threatening bloat...amazingly she survived :) To reduce the chances of future bloat I am now feeding her 4-5 times a day instead of only once. After researching, I found that a food high in protein and low in carbs/corn type grains was healthier and possibly less likely to cause bloat (there is very little known as to the causes of bloat so most information is just theoretical...no definitive findings). Well, I was happy to find that Blue Buffalo foods seemed to be tailored to exactly what I was in search of! In addition, my dog suffers from allergies and I had been supplementing her with Alaskan Salmon Oil for added Omega-3 and Omega-6. After reading about the Blue Buffalo Fish & Sweet Potato food I saw that it offered the additional Omega's and that if she was to eat it I would no longer need to do the separate supplement. Everything sounded wonderful! I placed my order and it arrived promptly. I tried getting her to eat the food for about a week or two before I decided it was a no go :( I tried mixing it with hot water for gravy...still, she never did take to it. She is typically a very accepting dog when new foods are introduced...however, with this food she was not. I wasn't bothered by the smell as were some other reviewers, but I'm not surprised by that since I had become accustomed to the salmon oil smell already. All in all, I do wish she had taken to the Blue Buffalo brand foods as I really like the approach they take with the ingredients and preparation methods. I tried her on the Lamb flavor too but she refused that as well. Although my experience with Blue Buffalo brand turned out to be one that wouldn't work, I would still recommend giving it a try for your pampered pup. It is a great food! Great ingredients! And made in the U.S.A. which is a definite plus! If you have the same problem that I did, the company offers a 30-day money guarantee through whatever retailer you buy from...IT'S WORTH A TRY FOR SURE!!! If you visit their website and fill in a short form they will snail-mail you a $5.00 off any size bag coupon :)"
102,Very satisfied little customer!,The dog enjoys this brand.  I cannot give him any other!  I tried others and he always loves this one.  I give this an A+++ from my dog!
103,Healthier Food for your dog,"My dogs like this Food. They eat it and their stool comes out solid. They're happy, I'm happy."
104,Blue buffalo dog food,My little ones love this food. It is perfect size if bites for small dogs. My dog never had any stomach problems  after it. Highly recommended.
105,Picky,My dog refuses to eat the little brown pieces. I have no clue why.
106,Bag sliced open,                    The media could not be loaded.
107,Good quality food for my boxer,                
108,My dog loves buffalo blue food," The dog food bag was sliced on one area of the bag, with dog food scattered in the box, giving us less than what we usually get for a 15lb bag. More like have a bag."
109,Blue Buffalo Dog Food,"Our boxer is a pretty picky eater. She has been having problems keeping weight on, so I was trying different foods. She loves this blue buffalo blend, so we have been feeding it to her for about 6 months. I won’t lie it is little pricy for dry food but my dogs are member of the family and deserve quality! She has regained some weight she had lost and just overall happier. That is what is important! I saw I could do auto delivery on Amazon so I tried it out. It is working out great and makes things very simple. I recommend it for the little extra discount and connivence"
110,My fur baby cleans the bowl,"She loves the beef and chicken, I also put the dry food in it Also."
111,Dog went straight for it.,My dogs love this food. Bonus that it is affordable
112,I Just Rated this Dog Food as Tasting Good,"My basset hound can be very particular when it comes to dry dog food.  Usually, she'll start at eating it, but then gets bored and I end up trying to doctor it up, so she eats it.  With Blue Buffalo, so far, she doesn't even hesitate when I put it in her bowl.  She's on her second bag, so fingers crossed."
113,Blue Buffalo is the best for your kids 🦮  🐾  also helps with their allergies,"My dog is certainly picky. She will eat dry food only when nothing else is around. That includes Iams and all the other preferable brands.Shipment arrived, poured into bowl and she did not hesitate. Very happy with purchase."
114,HEALTHY INGREDIENTS!,"Look - from what I can tell - this is good dog food - it’s a little expensive, but it’s supposedly to be a premium dog food - and there certainly are premium dog foods that cost more.I did lie a little in this review - as Amazon asked me how the flavor of this dog food was - I said it tasted good - but I really don’t know that - I didn’t actually eat it myself. My dog seems to like it - but lately he’s not speaking to me - so I can’t be sure! Dogs actually only have about 1/6th of human tastebuds - so, there’s a possibility it tastes like crap - but dogs don’t really know any better!"
115,"I Like The Poop, My Dogs Like The Food","I HAVE A GOLDENDUDDLE , AN ABUSED RESCUE PITBULL, AN 2 COCKER SPANIELS  “ CANDY AND SHILO “ THEY LOVE LAMB AND BROWN RICE ( BLUE BUFFALO)  THEY BEEN EATING THIS FOOD FOR YEARS . THEY ARE VERY HEALTHY THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS CANDY’S ALLERGIES BUT IS A TREATMENT THAT SHE HAS AND PART OF IT IS THE FOOD TOO. BLUE BUFFALO FOR THEM IS THE BEST BECAUSE I TRY OTHERS AND WOULDN’T EAT IT . I RECOMMEND BLUE BUFFALO LAMB AND BROWN RICE 100%"
116,Late but worth the wait,Both of my dogs love it and are thriving on this dog food!!!
117,My dog liked it for two days,"I switched to Blue Buffalo on a recommendation from my mother who has had bulldogs for years.  I had been using Iams Weight Control for my two Cocker Spaniels.  I gradually transitioned from the Iams to BB.  As the transition progressed, my dogs appeared to be more hungry at each feeding.  As it turned out, I think that they were just starting to enjoy their food for the first time in their short little lives. Sad, really.  But how can a person tell if a dog food actually tastes good?  If I were to pick a dog food based on what I THINK might taste good, I would be feeding my dogs Beneful dog food (their commercials make ME hungry).  In any case, they seem to love BB.  So that's the review from the dog's point of view.As for how this change in dog food has impacted MY life.  I live on a half acre and my two cockers can really spread wealth, if you know what I mean.  I really like to keep the lawn ""bomb free"" so my kids and I pick-up the lawn often.  When the dogs were eating Iams, the ""surprises"" that they would create would lay softly beneath the top blades of grass, just waiting for someone to come step on them.  It was too often an ugly situation that I will not describe here.  Since we have been feeding the dogs BB, those ""duce-balls"" now sit lightly upon the TOP of the grass.  They are light, easy to see and very firm (Eauwwwww!) As a result, pick-up is quicker and the lawn is cleaner.I suggest you give this food a try, but be cautious.  Based on some reviews, BB has had some quality problems in the past.  Nobody wants to lose their animal due to negligence on the part of a dog food company.  As with any change in your dog's diet, monitor closely.  Even if a food is safe and healthy, not all foods agree with all animals.  So remember, be cautious, we all want the best for man's best friend."
118,"Switched to a different type of food, but not mad at this one.",Awesome food. Fills my dogs up. It's like medicine... Very impressed.
119,Good dog food,Way too expensive.
120,Good,"So, my dog was fine eating this. He started on the puppy formula and progressed to adult formula. His poop was a little yellow and sometimes loose, so I switched him the BB's Limited Ingredient recipe that had lamb to see if that had an effect. I think chicken just isn't something his body handles in larger quantities (treats with chicken do not seem to impact him much), but that isn't the food's fault. Transferring to lamb basically instantly work for him. So, before you blame the brand, give either another protein a shot or try their grain-free or limited options. I try to keep my dog and a fairly monitored diet and preferred limited ingredient items. I did order this using Prime and as a one-time purchase. I do not advise buying food related items from a third party seller, but I have never had an issue with Prime items. The package arrive undamaged and no bug issues. Just make sure you check the bag and expiration before use because if food is exposed or outdated then of course you will see negative side effects. We keep this food in a storage tub in a room not exposed to sunlight, if that matters."
121,My girl loves it!,Our dogs love Blue Buffalo so I thought I would sign up for the auto delivery.  The first bag we received had a big cut in the side so not sure how fresh the product actually is.  Hopefully future bags are not cut open.
122,Perfect for our adult dog,Good
123,Wonderful foid,"My 6 month puppy loves everything about this product.  Digested well, poops without difficulty."
124,Subscribe!!,"We wanted something with natural ingredients, some thing that would not upset the stomach of our black lab/border collie mix adult dog. She is 11 years old. She is susceptible to digestive issues.Now all we feed her is Blue Mountain dog food, and it’s perfect. Unless she gets into something she shouldn’t be eating, she has absolutely no digestive issues at all. Very happy with the product."
125,Gooooodddddd,If your pets allergic to chicken this is a great alternative mine loves it.
126,"I just want a healthy dog, and this food helps with that.","I’ve waited 10+ 50lbs bags of chicken and brown rice dog food to review. This is definitely a great dog food option. My dogs get excited to eat this food every time I’m prepping it, plain!! Being a legit ingredients list is what drew me to it as an option for my dogs. (Switching food will cause some bathroom problems. My dogs went through it and are fine with the diet change now. Took a few weeks. They’re inside dogs and didn’t have any problems.)"
127,"Sadie is pretty picky about her food, but she eats this stuff up.","My dog love this flavor alot. I have a 4 years old pug and I try so many brand for him just wanna find a brand that he like and here we are. It smell good not like the other brands. He seem to eat more since I switched to this. Anyway, its so far so good. The shipment just came on time too"
128,"Have rescues, 12 & 8 years old. Both very healthy.","I’ve been feeding Jimmy Blue Buffalo since 10 weeks old. His coat is always shiny, no dandruff. I believe it’s well worth the price."
129,My precious baby loves it,"Kind of a strong odor when you first open the bag, but as long as she is happy and healthy, I'm okay with it."
130,My dog loves it!,Pricey but worth it.
131,My dogs love it,He is usually such a finicky eater but he chows this healthy food down. And it’s half the price of “designer “ dog food my vet recommends (and sells) and he actually eats it.
132,Been using product for several years.  Pets like it,We adopted our pittie girl a couple years ago and she couldn’t eat the brand of food our previous dog ate. I thought I’d try this and she loved it and still loves it! I can’t speak for ingredient quality exactly but it seems to be way better than the other brand.
133,"Good solid food for my picky eater, great ingredients, trust worthy. WITH grain.",My girl dog is super picky but she love it. And I'm happy I switch up flavors when I need to
134,Dog loves,Been using product for several years.  Pets like it
135,Great Dog Food,"I have used blue buffalo from the beginning. I have switched around a bit with the no grain, grain blah blah. I have come to the conclusion for my dog that grain is the way to go and thank goodness blue buffalo has a few options left, this being one. My border collie does great with this one. Reasonable price and easy to get."
136,Our dogs love it and more affordable than Hills,I have a Malshi who is 11 years old. Was told to try a healthier dog food because of skin issues. She is picky and wasn't a big fan of dry dog food until this brand. I gave 5 stars for the flavor because she likes it but I have not tried myself. :)
137,Dog food,"We've been buying Blue Buffalo for over a decade.  We switched from their Grain-Free version to the current Adult: Life Protection Formula after our vet conveyed that the community was concerned over specific health issues arising from major brand grain-free diets (not specifically Blue Buffalo), despite the causation being as yet unknown.  The dogs didn't seem to mind the change.We like the ingredient list, although we haven't personally chemically tested the food to confirm its accuracy.The freshness is apparent when you open the bag, and we've been buying for years and never gotten one that wasn't fresh.I cannot personally attest to the flavor.  The dogs do seem to like it, though they're picky little princesses so they prefer it mixed with a bit of chicken broth or a little wet food."
138,My dog loves it!,Weight management for older dogs. Dogs like it better than Hills. Certainly easier to find and considerably less expensive.
139,Delicious!,I usually buy Royal Cabin dry food geared especially for Golden retrievers. It became wildly expensive so I searched for the next best brand with a reasonable price. The dogs seem to love it. And it is so much more affordable.
140,So far so good!,I like everything about this dog food - since my dog likes it a lot and it's not full of artificial coloring - except the price.  It's just about doubled in a couple of years.  So I'm looking for a cheaper source....  But do highly recommend the product.
141,Changed seller Smaller bag More money,"My dog gobbles it up like it’s his last meal, and has for most of his life. While I can’t completely contribute it to the food, he’s 12 and still runs around like a puppy."
142,Both dogs like it!,No complains from the dog yet! 😉
143,My dog (and cat) loves it- but allergic,This was a good deal that I was going to subscribe to and the second order was $11 more and 8 lbs. lighter. So I guess I'm not getting any more on prime.
144,Great value,Both dogs like it. It's good quality
145,Kinda disappointed ☹️.,"The dog loves it, she kept trying to steal it while I was filling up/mixing with the old brand (Nutro) in her food storage container. I've also caught the cat stealing a couple pieces now and then during breakfast time! The stink is strong (meaty), probably why she loves it.***UPDATE my dog is apparently allergic to something in this. She's so itchy, eyes are watery and red, skin raw from rubbing. I feel so bad. We are transitioning to Inception dog food which after some research seems great for sensitive dogs."
146,good for dogs,When we ordered this came from Sams Club and was 38 pounds of food. What a bargain.
147,Your dog will luv it!,"After calling their headquarters, they told me that all their food bags have those brown bits, so I am disappointed 😞☹️.I have a small Yorkie who likes dry dog food.  But I am disappointed ☹️.  I called Blue company in Arizona and found out that many small breed dogs will take out the little brown bites of antioxidants and set them next to the bowl.  I was told to add warm water or broth, which didn't help.  I did like the fact that my dog's coat really improved.  Very shiny, so it is better than the store brand Ceasers that he was eating."
148,It got rid of my boxer's cysts!,Blue Buffalo is really good and all my dogs love it.
149,My dog has allergies and this food cleared her skin up,Great choice. Our dog loves it especially when it’s slightly heated.
150,Not Just The Bag Color That's Different,"My boxer loves it. I fed her the regular Blue Buffalo before because its pretty much the only kind she'll eat, without me having to mix in chicken breast or Cottage Cheese. She's a picky eater lolI don't know what's in this Healthy Weight stuff, or what's different between this one and the regular Blue Buffalo, but for over a year my dog had 2 pretty large cysts on her neck and her flank, that kept getting bigger and would sometimes burst open and leak, only to fill back up. (Both were benign) The vet told me I could have them removed and gave me an estimate....Within a month of feeding her the Healthy Weight, THEY DISAPPEARED. They're gone.Could the Makers of Blue Buffalo please tell me what's in it or isn't in it, that made the cysts go away?? Would be interesting to know, because cysts are very common in boxers.It could help other dog owners too, by avoiding certain ingredients or brands.I just saved a bunch of money (in surgery cost) by switching to Healthy Weight!Thanks"
151,Digestible,My dog was on an expensive hypoallergenic food but this is more affordable and she’s stopped itching! Plus she loves it! Eats it dry where she wouldn’t eat her other food if it didn’t have wet food in it!
152,Can’t tell you how it taste 🤷‍♀️.. it’s for dog  lol. But he seems to enjoy🐾✌️🙌,"So, this has been my Border Collie's food for two and a half years and he could barely wait until I got it into the bowl for him to eat it (my dog LOVES fish like none other). But that's completely changed.So, the bag color used to be pink for the fish and brown rice recipe and it used to smell really fishy. I mean, it was so fishy smelling that I had to buy an expensive container that fully sealed the food so I wouldn't have to smell it because I absolutely hate fish, but my dog loves it.Last month, we got a blue bag instead of pink. When I looked it up, I saw that Blue Buffalo had changed their bag color and had the messaging that it's a new look, but the same recipe. This is not true at all, it's different! My dog will not eat it unless he's really hungry (he full blown skipped eating for 36 hours before he would touch the stuff). I thought maybe he had an upset stomach, but this happened again a few different times.He also gets fairly lethargic after eating it too. Almost like digesting it is taking a lot out of him... and he's a 2 and a half year old Border Collie... so that's a big red flag when my Border Collie is low energy.That's not all either... the fish smell is gone. Seriously, not a single hint of fish at all in the smell of the food and I also noticed blue bag one leaves significantly larger residue behind in the dog bowl than the pink bag one did.It's unfortunate because I used Blue Buffalo for years with my previous Husky and for the last two years with my Border Collie and it's been great. But now, I'm on the hunt for a new food for him and cancelled my subscription for this one."
153,Blue Nose Pit Is Healthy and Loves This Food,My dog & I have a  subscrptn for this product. It is my go-to food for Gus. Gus was a severely abused pit bull; my bestie & my 7th high risk rescue. He has stomach aches & his food won't digest once a month.  He'll start by eating grass on walks & progresses. I will immediately switch his food to BlueBuff for a few days. In those days he will got to the bathroom regular. But he does not like it for an every meal food.
154,Convenient,Pic above of bandit after eating is new food by blue ✌️🐾🐾🐾❤️ . All good ingredients 🙌
155,Less poop!!,"I was feeding my dog ""Taste of the Wild"" and he seemed to be enjoying it for the most part. But as weeks progressed I noticed a terrible turn in his stool and his mood. I also noticed he wouldn't eat the food once a put it down, he would leave the food untouched for 2 to 3 days at a time. That's when I started to do more research. I started to compensate with Purina, but that only work for a week or so and it was back to unhealthy stool, lack of eating, downtrodden mood, and even vomiting. I started giving him peeled boiled potatoes, unseasoned white rice, and egg yolk just to put something in his belly. One day I was at home and clear as day I thought ""Blue Buffalo"" I know it was the LORD speaking to me because I had never inquired or researched this specific product. I didn't hesitate, nor did I speculate. I jumped on Amazon and ordered this product which arrived 2 days later. Jackson (my blue nose pit) dove head first into his dog dish leaving no remainings. At first I thought maybe because he really liked it as he does most dog food upon initially trying it. But then I noticed a dramatic change in his stool, in his weight and in his behavior. I waited to see if any bad symptoms would reoccur but nothing happened. Jackson is well and loves his food. 15 pound will last a month and 30 pounds will last 2 months. I still give him the white rice and egg yoke occasionally. Rice puts more weight on him and egg yoke shines his coat something wonderful. Overall, Great dog food. Thank You JESUS and Thanks Amazon"
156,Blue Buffalo is all I feed my dogs!,"Was very convenient to have this delivered to the front porch.  For anyone that rated the flavor, did you taste it?  I am just taking the dogs word for it."
157,My dog is very picky and she loved it!,"Here is possibly TMI...my dog started pooping SO MUCH on her old food! It was Kirkland turkey and sweet potato which had been fine for years. Maybe they changed their formula, I dunno. She was going outside to go poop 5 or 6 times a day, minimum. She used to go just twice a day, after breakfast and after dinner. Plus, it was like soft serve ice cream, mushy and hard to pick up. And clearly her bottom was irritated, she was licking it a lot. Super gross, all the way around.So I decided to try this Blue formula. I used to have a cat with health problems that did really well on the Blue brand so trying it for my dog was an easy decision. We started with a 25/75 new/old food ratio and by the time we were 50/50 I noticed a difference. Her poops were more solid and there were less of them. It is day 1 of just this new food now. She has been out to go potty twice, and only pooped right after breakfast, and I am thrilled! Again, TMI but it is harder, drier poop. Easier to pick up and doesn't smell as gross either.Even though it is spendier than the Costco food, ordering thru Amazon was cheaper than any local store's sale price and I love that it came to my door, rather than me schlepping it in and out of a cart, my car and up the stairs to my place. But we are so happy with this food that I dont mind paying more and would gladly schlepp it anywhere!"
158,Only the best for my pup!,For 10+years blue buffalo has been my absolute go to for my dogs!
159,The dog likes it,"My dog usually eats Purina. I am aware that is isn't the most natural food...Anyway, after Lady sits still for her ear cleaning she knows that she always gets a treat. We stopped at PetSmart and a sales person came over to pet Lady. Lady totally loves people so she was jumping all over the sales lady and licking her face.Eventually she was like ""you have an awesome dog. What do you feed her?""I said Purina.""That's like the McDonald's of dog food""I said ""I know it's unhealthy but you have no idea how hard it was to find something she would actually eat. If she doesn't like a food she just sniffs her bowl and walks away and she'll starve herself for days. I was feeling like a terrible doggy mom before we found Purina.""""I am going give you a few sample bags of some healthy dog food and I bet you she'll eat them!""Of the three samples, Lady would not eat a single one she would put it in her mouth and spit it back on the floor (2 flavors were Simply Nurish and 1 flavor was Nutro).This story was just to illustrate how hard it's been to find something Lady will eat. A few weeks ago our Vet said that she was getting a little chunky and I've been following the directions on the Purina package to the letter (Lady is 1 year old so she is very energetic and she gets a good amount of exercise and she NEVER gets people food) so he said we needed to switch foods because that was the likely culprit.Tried this Blue Buffalo and she adores it!"
160,Nut free!,"Quality dog food, excellent price, super quick shipping!  Can't go wrong here!"
161,Goose loves and great for his skin,I used this for the dog
162,Great quality,"I guess like a lot of parents, my children have certain chores that they do to help out around the house.  One of my 4 year olds chores (that she actually loves to do) is feeding our dog.  One morning, she fed our dog his name-brand dog food and, mid-munching, our dog turned about and licked our daughter on the cheek.  My daughter immediately broke out in hives.My daughter has lots of food allergies, one of which is peanuts.  Imagine my horror when I looked at our name-brand dog food and realized peanuts were a main ingredient!  I always read food labels to keep my daughter safe, but it never occurred to me that I needed to check the dog's food.  I immediately set about trying to find a dog food that didn't have nuts.  I couldn't find one at our local big-box store.  I got on amazon and found Blue Buffalo!!Blue Buffalo, not only is great for my dog, but it's NUT FREE!  I can let my daughter feed our dog and not worry that she's going to have a severe allergic reaction!  I would buy it just because it's nut-free, but I've been so pleased with the quality of the food and the benefits to our dog as well.  Our dog eats less of this than he did of the name-brand dog food we were buying.  His coat seems shinier.  The *only* disappointment, which really isn't one, is that it didn't ""cure"" my dog's shedding.  (No, we didn't seriously think it would, but there's always wishful thinking.)We happily are repeat customers and this is the only dog food we'd get for our dog!"
163,High quality dog food,This product has really helped with his itchy skin! One week and the itching has stopped.
164,She loves it!,SUper dog food...one of the best.  My dog loves it and being 11 years old she still wants to play and romp.  I feed her what I consider excellent products for her health and longevity and I very much prefer this dog food.
165,A high quality product.,"My dogs love this stuff. I have a Boston terrier and a (wait for it) a Basset-Doodle... Bassetoodle? Basset-poo? Poodle Hound? Well, anyway, she's half Basset Hound and half miniature poodle, making her 100% French, and kind of picky. The food her breeder (I know, hard to imagine what they were thinking) had been feeding her was full of food coloring (and possibly roadkill)... That poor puppy threw up every day until I switched her to Blue Buffalo. My Boston is a little sensitive to wheat, so I needed to accommodate their very different issues if possible. Both of my dogs are seniors now, though I feed them this regular adult dog formula, and very healthy. Amazon tends to have a great price on this product.Here's the reason for only four stars, and not five. The good news -- buying from Amazon means I don't have to drive (28 miles) to a specialty pet supply place, somehow get help to convey a heavy bag off the shelf, cart it through the store and hoist it into my car. HOWEVER, and this might be the only downside, I get it delivered to my PO Box. Both the postmaster and I wish it could be shipped to my front door -- it's super heavy, and neither one of us is all that strong. She refuses to lift it at all. So, I get to drag it through the post office, out the heavy door, hoist it into my car, and unload it myself at the house... In summary, delivery to my front porch would earn this Amazon offering five stars in my book!"
166,High Quality + Dog Loves It,My dog loves the flavor and her bowel movements are all solid but not dry. Very good for her digestive system. Highly recommend.
167,My American Eskimo likes it,A high quality product.
168,My Dog never has had issues,My dog is going on about 15 years old and is 50 pounds. Almost half of his teeth have been removed (see below for why I recommend the small bite formula). I wish I had fed him food of this quality all these years.I made the switch over to Blue Buffalo about a year ago from 
169,Very convenient,"Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 30-Pound Bag"
170,No. Just no.,". He gobbled up the chicken and brown rice flavor right away. I noticed the following benefits within the first week of feeding him this:1. Noticeable energy - he is up and running around a little more than usual. He also has a more lively look in his eyes.2. Appetite - his appetite neither went up nor down, but I have noticed that he loves this food. At first he ate about a half to a full cup more than I normally give him, but that tapered back down to his normal amount by the end of the first week.3. Digestion - I have purchased both the regular and small bite pellet sizes, and he digests the small bite pellets better. He has had many teeth removed, so I have noticed that the small bite formula is easier on his gums and teeth.Overall, I highly recommend this food. You pay more for it, but I noticed an immediate difference in my dog's health. To me, that's worth the price. If your dog has had teeth removed, then I also recommend their small bite formula."
171,Questionable dog food!,He doesn't seem to agree with chicken . He eats the dry food without wet food. Arrived 2 day prime. Will subscribe and save. He has regular business outside and no accidents. Belly doesn't seem upset. Been feeding him this for 5 months. He's 2 years old
172,He's still eating it.,That it's fish flavor and it's one of the only ones that are. And haven't changed their ingredients since we've bought it
173,Rancid,It arrives on time and I subscribe so I don’t have to worry about running out of dog food.
174,Great Item,"1/20/2022Bella (2 year old 30lb lab retriever mix) has been on this food for about a week and I just canceled my subscription and got a refund.My refund note was: Food is causing diarrhea, severe hair loss, itching/biting, loss of appetite, excessive gas, and bad breath in my dog. I've purchased this food from Walmart in the past and didn't get this reaction.I ran out of characters so I'll emphasize more here.At first, I thought the hair loss was because she had a bath last weekend but she's reached the point where her hair is falling out in clumps when she scratches her neck. I'm constantly wiping fur off my face and getting it caught in my nose. It's everywhere.Her poops will start off solid then slowly get softer until they're liquid.Her breath now smells like leaking anal glands.Usually, she'd gobble down all the food as soon as I set it down, but now she'll just sniff it and walk away... She still follows me and constantly jumps up on two legs before I set it down, but now she'll eat her food maybe 5 hours later or eat it in slow increments. She just doesn't enjoy eating anymore.Before this, she transitioned from the local food she had at the humane society to a 6lb pound bag of blue I bought at Walmart and was fine. I wanted a better food that isn't only sold at one local county store. It was $18+ for the 6lb bag so I opted to subscribe to the 15lb bag on here to get a better price, 5% off, then 5% cash back with the Amazon credit card.After reading the reviews I can see I'm not the only one having problems. The Walmart bag didn't do anything to her, but I'd rather not take the risk again even with the store bags. I dug deeper into the bag and didn't see any mold, ants, maggots or even rat skin... that the other reviews mentioned. It smells fine, looks alright, and doesn't expire until 23'.I thought this food would be fine because it had good reviews and decent ingredients. The FDA is currently reviewing grain-free food and foods containing peas and other legumes or potatoes as main ingredients so I steered clear of that. Some of the reviews said this food contains lead so I'll look into that.I'll be transitioning to a new food shortly and update this review afterwards! Do research and keep your babies safe!"
175,Love Blue Buffalo But...,"I have ordered Blue Buffalo dog food for years, but for some reason this fish and brown rice recipe upset the stomachs of my 3 dogs. All three dogs suffered runny stools we believe from eating this product. We have discontinued feeding this recipe and have since gone back to deboned chicken and brown rice and the dogs are doing well."
176,My dogs love it,"Well, I guess he likes it because he eats it but it could be because I buy it for him. If he survives this 30lb bag I will give a follow up review.  Can you all tone it down on the life source bits because they are giving my dog a little to much Life. I'm old and cant chase this nut because of these powerful bits!"
177,Decent dog food,"The doggos seem underwhelmed with this food, and they are not picky. We have a food storage container that seals up well, but this food smells rancid from the get-go. Second time, I won’t be buying again."
178,Don’t buy from amazon,Great Item
179,My Dog LOVES Blue Buffalo's Adul Life Protection Formula - but It IS MAKING HIM SICK NOW..,"I love grain free Blue Buffalo food. It really helps with the allergies and the boys love it. My ""but"" comes from the fact it's cheaper to order from Chewey and the orders come within 48 hours. Not a lot cheaper but every penny counts at this point."
180,Tasteful for my dog,My dogs love it
181,multiple dogs have issues with this food.,I tried this dog food when I could not get the dog food my dog likes.  My dog is a picky eater and did not care for this food.
182,great product,Our 2 year old German Shepard has been eating Blue Buffalo since we got her at 8 weeks…and this type for almost a year. I ordered through Amazon because they had a good deal on it and only received 2 bags. The last bag we got from Amazon was just opened a little over a week ago and our dog has not peeing out of her butt since then. We took away food for 24hours for it to stop and then start right back up again after eating this food. I just went to the pet store to buy a regular bag and hopefully it’ll fix this because I’m tired of waking up every two hours to let her poop.
183,Buyer beware !!! Somethings definitely off.,"I wrote a great review for Blue Buffalo when I first got this kibble. My other dog has the senior version as well.  I noticed that both dogs were licking themselves more and chewing on themselves more. Lots of itching and scratching and more than when they were on their previous dry food.(Each dog was on a different blue buffalo food. VERY ODD!!!)One dog has chewed into the skin on their paw.. the other was started vomiting food.  I noticed that there were more than 40 complaints about this on Amazon..  and that's NOT GOOD.I would not recommend you try this food .. or if you do, buy very small quantities.I am shocked that Amazon didn't notice  all the negatives and that no one in Blue Buffalo heard about it.I will be contacting them too.<<MY OLD REVIEW>>I was concerned about my dog when I switched dog food. He's a picky eater and doesn't always want to eat what's put in front of him.  However,  he loves this Blue  Buffalo kibble for dogs.  When I walk him early every morning, I take a bag of kibble with me because I know he will be hungry. I didn't want to give him treats when we walked.. so I use kibble. He LOVES it. He eats about 3-4.5 oz every single morning.  That's a  lot of dry kibble... and even if he drops some kibble while eating the small handful I gave him, he eats up anything he drops. This Blue Buffalo formula is terrific! (And my dog's coat is shiny, gorgeous and  he's healthy!Considering they had only been on the food for less than 3 weeks, I am going  to ask for a refund. for each Blue Buffalo food type.. and I will be notifying Blue Buffalo.I started each dog on entirely new food and they aren't puking or chewing nearly as much.BEWARE and BE Aware. Read the blue buffalo critical reviews on Amazon"
184,My dog ate it,My pet likes the food.
185,Great for my goldendoodle,after a decade+ of dogs testing even the highest quality kibble i'm starting to believe that dog kibble is just low quality cheap slop that is left over from processing other parts for human needs.  yet to find a bullet proof food that can actually help your dog perform at a high level.  randomly bags of this food make my current dogs sick. next.
186,Happy dogs!,Best food for the $.No more allergy's for my German Shepard.
187,Shipping mistake,"Let me start off by saying I absolutely love blue buffallo. That being said, I've had this a part of my amazon subscribe and save forever but the last time something was terribly off.Half way into finishing the bag my dog got seriously sick, lost a lot of her hair and even her appetite. She started chewing furiously all herself all over her body and eventually she would smell the kibble and walk away which she never does. At first I thought maybe fleas or mange or something of the sort but after getting her checked out nothing was wrong with her in that sense.I inspected her food and it definitely smelled different than before. I decided to check the reviews on Amazon and saw similar complaints... well I dumped out the entire bag and decided to grab a small bag of the same brand and flavor and what do you know, she ate it like she hadn't seen food in forever.I smelled the new bag of blue buffalo that I purchased from the store and it didnt smell bad at all unlike the one I got from amazon.A few days after feeding her the bag from the store she already had major improvement in her mood and appetite and her hair started growing back. No more biting like crazy either.Needless to say I canceled my amazon subscribe and save and will be getting it from the store from now on. In fact I refuse to buy anything on Amazon that our family ingests or puts on our bodies like lotions and whatnot anymore. I don't know ir its a bad batch or a fake product or what but it's just not worth the risk."
188,Open product,"My dog ate this food when we put it in his bowl. He also eats his own poop from time to time and once ate a tampon. So the bar is very low, but he seemed to like this better than the poop."
189,Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula,Great for my goldendoodle
190,6 dogs… nobody likes it😭,Our dogs enjoy this brand. We frequent this flavor and brand.
191,"Dogs love it, but bag ripped",Sent wrong size bites.  Need small adult bites.  My 2 dogs are small and missing teeth.  Love the formula and they enjoy it but can’t return these 2 bags.
192,excellente,The product is awesomeBut unfortunately it was delivered open.Although it’s open in small area I will still not be giving it to my best friend (dog).Please look into this matter.
193,Love Blue,Great ingredients and my dogs seem to like it.  I have ordered several times and will continue.
194,Dogs love it!,I have to mix it with their old food to get it used up…one dog seem to get loose stool’s from it… we are finally almost through the bag…won’t buy again.
195,My dog loves it!,"First time ordering dog food from Amazon. Couldn’t believe the dogs both ate this food dry-they loved it. However, the bag was ripped in the box, causing loose dry food  in box. I don’t know if I will order again from Amazon, but will definitely start using this dog food."
196,My dog likes it.,como dije fue y es una muy buena election
197,Blue Buffalo is a high quality dog food!,"I love Blue.  I did not buy it for a long time because I simply could not afford it.  It was outside of my budget.  Now, I simply can't afford to not buy it.  My dog loves it and she always eats and and never wastes it.  Before if she would not eat her dog food because she did not feel good, I would have to throw it away as she would continue to refuse to eat until I got fresh out.  With Blue, it can sit out for a couple of days and she will eat it still.  They have what I need when I need it and I can easily switch from one to another without her going through diarrhea or tummy issues.  This has been a great brand for both my dog and cat and I will stick with it."
198,WARNING!!!! Caused extreme sickness in my dog,Dogs have been loving it for many years now
199,Smells like Chicken & ...Blueberries?,She’s always been a picky eater. She gobbles this down like a kid with candy!
200,Great,My dog likes it so that's the most important thing.
201,Tasty.,"I bought Blue Buffalo Life Protection dog food to replace the prescription dog food we previously used.  The dog loves it and I can't ask for more.There are many negative reviews out there from several years ago. This all seem to be related to a lawsuit from another company.  Why Amazon keeps showing them I do not know, but they should be taken with a grain of salt."
202,Always Fresh never expired,"**** EDITED to let everyone know our sweet doggie had to be put to sleep yesterday as she was suffering to greatly. Vet thinks its from mold in her food. ****Our dog right now is on a IV at the vets and they are trying to keep her alive. She has been very sick since consuming the last bag of Blue that came from Amazon two weeks ago....If you read on you’ll find that other dogs and their owners are experiencing the same thing. I really hope that Blue Buffalo will refund our vet bill because they can in no way give our dog her life back if we loose her.I’ve received five emails from Amazon since 6:30 PM last night. I’ll post a picture of that below as to save anyone else from going though what we are.My dog has eaten this exact food for maybe six years without any issues and we always order from Amazon so I’m not certain what happened with this batch. You can also read consumer affairs the reports from the last 2 to 3 weeks about this food to be the same as the complaints here on Amazon. For whatever reason this food is making some dogs very very ill. Are started with vomiting, losing weight, being lethargic and then blood in her stool. Are smaller dog ate about a half of a handful of it and became sick as well, not the food we normally feed him so he was switched back over instantly.....Don’t risk it!!! Of course we tried to call the blue Buffalo number and they won’t be open again for phone calls until Monday and I got that email after they were already closed on a Friday night :(Younger dog may bounce back more quickly but due to my dogs age they aren’t sure she is going to pull through. She has jaundice and her liver is not working properly...She was a perfectly healthy dog before eating this last batch of food."
203,Too expensive,"I don’t know why, but my dog doesn’t seem to care for the small, black-ish kibble that (I guess) represent dried blueberries. He doesn’t hate them, but he usually avoids them to the extent he can. And my dog is not a picky eater. This is a minor complaint, because he still eats and eats well. And he is very healthy, and my vet agrees.I haven’t tasted the offending kibble myself yet, so I can’t say if they have a particular flavor. But in general I think things in dog food that are engineered to look like other (more appealing) things for the benefit of the owner, not the dog, are unnecessary.Overall, the food really does smell like chicken, which is about as good as it gets, as long as the flavor is “chicken”. I haven’t tried other flavors, but if they all smell like chicken I’ll update my review."
204,Seems my dogs allergies are lesser with lamb over chicken,Seems to be regulating my dogs system which was pretty irregular with iams. A little pricey but definitely worth it. This bag was pretty fresh.
205,Great,"Dog like it, but i have to change flavor often."
206,:),"Was skeptical about ordering dog food online due to not being able to see the expiration date . Thought why not try it and see.  Happy to say there was no problem here, and delivery was fast. No complaints form my pooch."
207,Highly recommend,"Good dog food, i guess.  My girl seemed to like it ok, but too expensive."
208,Rat droppings?,Liked it
209,I like how they ask me about it’s flavor…. It was delicious!,My did like it coming late
210,Great Product!,Dogs like it
211,Do Not Buy!!,"After slowly transitioning to this food over the period of a week, I did notice some looser stools just as many other people reviewing this product.  Towards the end of this transition time the stools became normal and it is a dogfood that he loves to eat.  I can't say that the ""lifebits"" that are in the mix is his favorite thing to eat, but most of the time his bowl is clean.  If he leaves anything in his bowl, it would be a few (2-3) of those which is a very small percentage of what was in the bowl to begin with.My dog IS a PICKY eater and with other brands I have often had to add a small treat to his bowl in order for him to eat it all, but I do not have that issue with this brand.  The one thing that I have done is to add some warm water to the bits which makes them softer as well as release the aroma and flavor.  My dog reacts the same way as he would have if I put some gravy on top of his food when I do that.He has gone from walking up to his bowl and looking at me wondering where his ""treat"" is so that he can eat to jumping up on his hind legs, bouncing around excited that he is about to be fed.The only downside I can think of with this product is that just like some other posters pointed out, there was evidence of some loose stool during transition and that the lifebits does not seem to be something that he enjoys eating."
212,Charlie The Beagle Approves!,"There were these old pebbles in it that didn’t seem to belong. These pebbles look like rats dropping. I didn’t like them in my dogs food so I would pull them out. there was about 1-2 pebbles approximately every scoop of food provided to my dog. Which seems like a lot. Every time I fed her I would go through the scoop and pull them out, unless they were some special vitamin I think blue buffalo should look into this. Other than that, my dog appeared to enjoy the food and also appeared appetizing for my dog."
213,Great ingredients,He eats it and he seems to be thriving
214,Best food ever,"I love this Blue dogfood! I have been giving this to my dogs for a few years now and I'm 62 and have had dogs all my life. The quality of this food is outstanding. There are so many dog foods out there that shouldn't be consumed by any animal. I want my 3 dogs to be happy and healthy like we all do and my Labradoodle is 8 and has always been healthy, thank goodness, my mini Aussie is 10 and she is reasonably healthy for 10 as well and I also have a Shih Tzu who is 4 and he very rarely throws up which is common because of there flat noses and I put all this down to this food. They never leave any, they sleep well, they listen, most of the time.....lol  and I put all this down to good nutrition. I want them to live forever like we all do so I believe they need to eat the right foods, no scraps, cause a lot are toxic to them, so I would definitely recommend this food......Thank you 'Blue' you make my doggies happy!!"
215,He loves it,I couldn't figure out why my dog started losing her hair and having terrible allergic reaction to the only kind of food she has ever ate and when I started buying it on Amazon the problems started. After reading the reviews it makes sense because everyone else is having similar issues.
216,Buffalo Blue Dog Food,"While I haven't actually fully tasted the food, Charlie the Beagle is always excited after he eats and runs to kiss my face. He really seems to like this food and I think it makes him a happy and healthy dog. The only thing is sometimes he picks out the life source bits. I try to reason with him and say that he needs his healthy life source bits to continue to grow and be a healthy dog, but he doesn't always listen. I included two pics of Charlie Beagle. The one with his mouth open and jumping up is him being happy right after eating Blue Buffalo food. (Doesn't he look happy?) The other picture is of him without his Blue Buffalo. (He kind of looks sad) Pictures say it all!"
217,BLUE GRAIN DOG FOOD,"Have been buying it for years, extremely happy with freshness, ingredients, and pup loves the flavor."
218,Om Nom Nom!,"We literally tried 10 different high-quality dog food so far for my dog who has a really sensitive stomach and nothing seemed to work. The Blue Buffalo really did the trick, she never threw up and this is the first one which doesn't cause her diarrhea. Her hair looks shiny and she likes the taste. She is a high energy dog and I had trouble with previous foods because she actually needed way more than it was suggested on the feeding instruction but with BB she needs a less than suggested on the feeding instructions (I always adjust it to her activities, current weight, weather etc).I found the reviews here really concerning. Many people just switch food from one day to the other and then are surprised that the dog gets sick. A few people said the dog had digestive issues for weeks before visiting the vet... I understand that you are disappointed and worried but I don't think the food is the issue in many of these cases. Also not every food is good for every dog,  but it doesn't mean there is anything wrong with Blue Buffalo, just like there is nothing wrong with the X other premium category food that did not work for us."
219,My dog loves this food.,Dogging loves it
220,Simply Amazing,Best dog food for my dog. My dog enjoys this flavor the most if I get her the green bag she doesn’t like it to much. She’s been eating this since a baby
221,my dog likes it,I have two standard poodles and one tiny Yorky. I was buying the tiny Yorky food for the tiny puppies and once she made a-year-old she started eating a large dog food for the standard poodles. She does not like the little round brown dark brown balls in it she picks them out but she loves the food. My big dogs eat every bit of it I have had them on many different kinds of food and they love BLUE!  I highly recommend this food my dogs have done great on it and they changed right over with not having runny stools. Again I had to recommend this food but the one with grain free not the one that’s grain free they have found that grain free is affecting some dogs brains and killing them.  If you prefer to have a grain free food blue also makes that that I feed my dogs the one with the brain and I highly recommend it
222,Huge bag with a flavor the dogs love,"My dogs are crazy.  I've tried for years to get them to eat high quality foods.  We've done Innova Evo, Wellness, Canidae, Call of the Wild.  They always act like I'm torturing them.  So I would end up feeding them Purina Pro Plan and feeling bad about life.  One day, my husband accidentally purchased a bag of Purina One and then they insisted that was the only food for them.  They decided to bunch Pro Plan in with the health foods and boycott it.One of my dogs is pretty skinny with a very high metabolism, so I can't afford him showing ribs and convincing people I'm not feeding him.  So for a while I gave in, and just mixed a high quality food in with the Purina One and let them pick out the pieces.Anyways, I decided to try Blue Buffalo because I was almost out of food and my car was acting funny and there it was on Amazon Prime... HOLY HELL they love this food!  They just eat it right up, no complaints, no looking back at me expectantly.  They enjoy it even more than they enjoyed their garbage food, and I don't have to feel bad about what I'm feeding them!The ingredients are great, the caloric content is good and pretty dense for my skinny boy, and the kibble size is good for my three sized dogs (XL, Medium, and Small but Fat).I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors and perhaps trying a higher quality Blue Buffalo food, but for now I'm just glad they're eating something decent for once!"
223,"My dog seemed to like it the first 4 meals, but after that refused to eat it.",My dog will only eat blue branded foods. It is crazy. He loves it so much.
224,Life source bits - our dogs spit them out.,"Blue Buffalo has been a miracle for us.  When we first got our sweet little girl, she was already two years old and had lived a rough life with not the best care or food.  We were told that she was fed a store brand generic food, which she would gobble down as fast as she could when it was in front of her.  After a few weeks we started having issues with our new family member, it seemed like every other day she was having a seizure which usually occurred a few hours after her food was eaten.  After numerous vet appointments the suggestion was made to give her a better food, so after quite a bit of research we settled on Blue Buffalo.  I am happy to say that we have now had our Baby Girl for 5 years and we have been seizure free since the switch.  I can honestly say you get for what you pay for in this case, she has more energy, her coat looks 100% better, and she no longer gobbles down her food, but enjoys it throughout the day. I highly recommend Blue to anyone that has a dog or cat, its simply one of the best foods on the market.  Thank You Blue for helping our little girl and making her a permanent part of our family."
225,My dogs love it,i dont like price hike though for only 30lbs
226,good product,"This. Bag. Is. HUGE!!When we saw this box on our doorstep, we had no idea what it was - maybe a table, huge cutting board, or a piece of furniture? As the owner of two small dogs, we had never gotten a really big bag of dog food before.Enter the Blue Buffalo mega bag! We felt like we were dog owners with a Saint Bernard when we opened up the box and saw this giant bag of fishery for the pups. The dogs had really been enjoying Natural Balance dry dog food that was fish and sweet potato flavor, but it was a little too pricey. We switched to Blue Buffalo gradually and the pups love it just as much, if not more!One of our dogs used to eat wet food, but he really loves Blue Buffalo products even more. It's been substantially easier for us and it's been a lot better for his teeth to eat dry dog food. The wet, raw food he had been eating was leading to a lot of tartar build up and we're really happy that we have him on a food that he likes that's good for his teeth. They've tried the Blue Buffalo chicken flavor as well, but I think the fish is where it's at.For our two dogs (9 lbs and 20 lbs), this mega bag will easily last us months! We love Blue Buffalo products!"
227,Picky pups but they like this product!,"My dog seemed to like it and the contents of the food seemed to be very good.  She ate it eagerly the first 4 meals then refused to eat it.  I added Blue Buffalo canned food and she ate eagerly for 3 meals, then refused to eat it again. She IS a very picky eater!"
228,Excellent,"Our 3 dogs only eat the kibble part of the food and leave the life source bits on the floor, where we often step on them on accident and it makes a mess. But maybe your dog will love this food!"
229,My dog is highly allergic & so far it's alright!,"I was turned on to this food by a rescue organization and figured they knew what they were doing … my dogs eat the fish and brown rice flavor. If dogs could talk, I could tell you all about freshness and flavor … but seems to keep their attention!"
230,Good Deal,dogs like it-quick delivery and reasonable price
231,Quality and flavor,Nice small size morsels
232,.,Excellent
233,This may give your dog Montezuma's revenge,My dog do like this product.
234,AMAZING,Good Value
235,Dogs like it but......,Lamb flavor
236,Dog loves ❤️,Love the benefits of blue buffalo dog food and dogs love the taste I just wish there were not as small bites even in the large breed there is tiny little kibbles
237,Rottweiler Approved,"I have two dogs and I like to change up their food so it's not the same ole same ole. I decided to buy this Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula because it has quality ingredients but it gave my dogs the runs. To be fair the bag does say to transition your dog over to this food slowly. Well, I didn't read that part until after I noticed the dogs had Montezuma's revenge. This dog food is made with higher quality ingredients than other foods. The dogs seem to like it just fine. Just read the bag before starting off with this or you could be cleaning up some very messy poops."
238,Great food for dogs  Blue is all we ever buy. Spend a lil more to keep your pets healthy,"My dog changed. Her coat is so wonderful and shiny, sheds less. She filled out. Goes out less. Calmer. All by food? Wont shop in WM for dog food ever again AMAZING RESULTS. Worth the money for the health of my dog."
239,Fast and easy delivery,"My dogs really liked this food. We would add some warm water to it and they would munch it down. Our 2 large dogs and 4 small dogs ate the food and their fur and skin was much healthier. We had all our dogs and cats changed to BB in about Nov. so it has been almost 3 months. We now have decided to change food because our dogs and cats stopped using the potty regularly. Just a few days ago we took one cat to the vet and she had a UTI combined with swollen/inflamed bowels. Never had we had problems before, until BB. I didn't want to wait until any of my other cats or dogs got sick so we just threw out all the BB food. I had read the bad reviews here on amazon but I didn't think that such a well known brand of food could be bad. I figured the reviews were probably just lies to try and sway people to another brand, or that maybe it was just a coincidence that certain pets got sick-not because of BB. But now I saw for myself that although this food is good, it is actually too good; its not balanced which can cause issues in the animals. Do research on BB before you decide whether its the right fit for your animals."
240,My picky eater likes it.,My St Bernarn Boxer Mix loves this dog food
241,Dogs love it,"Since I rescued my Rottweiler, I changed his food to this and it has helped his coat and his weight dramatically. I have fed it to him for the last two years that I have now had him, and he is doing wonderful. I highly recommend blue buffalo"
242,Good dog food,Blue dog food is all I buy
243,Freshness,Love this dog food - and my dog loves it as well
244,Very good dog food for your animals,It’s been hard to find a food that the picky eater and the larger dog can agree upon. This seems to be a good compromise for them both.
245,Good food,Have 2 older dogs. This got them down to their correct body weight. Vet very happy & told me this is great stuff.
246,Wish it included salmon,Dog food
247,"My dog loves it, can’t vouch for the flavor (haven’t tried it)","This food is causing my dog a lot of diarrhea according to the vet, even though the food is not expired, he tells me that it must be damaged, they prescribed another type of food"
248,My dog loves it!,Have no issue with the dog food very good for your pets
249,My dog loves it.,We always feed this.
250,,"Trying to find a large breed dog food with salmon is difficult.  Our Golden seems to like this food, but he has outdoor allergies that affect his skin.  I really want to include salmon in his diet to help his skin.  We do not want grain free or break the bank on a super expensive dog food.  Not sure we will stick with this food.  We alternate among several different bags but overall we are happy with Blue Buffalo.  It would be nice if Amazon listed or posted the ingredients with percentages from the side of the bag.  Some of the Blue bags have the ingredients listed on the side of the bag and those pictures are not included for viewing."
251,,My dog loves it.
252,,"This is all we feed our dog. She never ignores the food and will eat it all. I am guessing the fact we do not feed her table scraps helps because that is the only food she will have, except for Kirkland or Milk Bone dog biscuits as treats. Our dog's poops are consistent and solid, and she has not vomited up the food at all. I could get cheaper stuff like WalMart's Ol'Roy or Pedigree, but I was sold on the ingredients and reputation of Blue Buffalo. Nutro was the only other dog food I considered, and Blue Buffalo ""won"" my research."
253,,My black lab dances for his food every day. His coat is shiny.
